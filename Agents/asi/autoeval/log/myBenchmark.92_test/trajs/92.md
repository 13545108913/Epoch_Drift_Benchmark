## Intent

Abishek wants to check my dotfile configurations. Please invite him to the repo as a guest.

## RM

Thoughts: The user's intent is to invite Abishek to the repo as a guest so he can check the dotfile configurations. This is a content modification task (specifically, modifying the repository's member list by adding a user with a guest role). The action history shows the agent navigated to the repo members page, searched for "Abishek", and clicked to invite him as a guest. The final state confirms the invitation was successful, with a success message and Abishek appearing in the members list with the "Guest" role. The bot's response is not needed for evaluation per the task type, but it correctly reports the success. Therefore, the task is successful.

Status: success

## Final Response "Successfully invited Abishek S (@abisubramanya27

===============
===============Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see the project navigation sidebar with a "Members" link. The previous action failed because it couldn't find element with bid "513". Let me look for the correct Members link in the navigation.

From the tree, I can see there's a "Members" link in the project navigation sidebar with bid "500". Let me click that instead to navigate to the members management page.
===============Looking at the current page state, I can see we're already on the "Project members" page. The goal is to invite Abishek as a guest to the repository. I can see the invitation form is present with:

1. A search box for "GitLab member or Email address" (bid 603)
2. A role dropdown set to "Guest" (bid 611)
3. An "Invite" button (bid 625, currently disabled)

Since the role is already set to "Guest" (which matches our requirement), I need to search for Abishek in the member search box to enable the invite button.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that after filling "Abishek" in the search box, there's an autocomplete result showing "Abishek S @abisubramanya27" (bid 786). This is the user we want to invite. I need to select this user from the autocomplete results to enable the invite button.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that after clicking on "Abishek S" from the autocomplete results, the user has been selected in the invitation form. The role is already set to "Guest" which matches our requirement. Now the "Invite" button should be enabled and ready to be clicked to complete the invitation process.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that the invitation was successful - there's a success message "Users were successfully added." and Abishek S @abisubramanya27 now appears in the members list with "Guest" role. The goal has been accomplished - Abishek has been invited to the repository as a guest to check the dotfile configurations.
