## Intent

List all opened issues that report bugs

## RM

Thoughts: The user's intent is to list all opened issues that report bugs. The agent's action history shows it performed a search for issues with the label "bug" and then sent a message to the user. However, the bot's response only lists one issue (#15) and omits the second issue (#28) that is present in the final webpage state. Since the task is information seeking and the response must contain the information the user wants, the incomplete list means the agent failed to fully provide the requested information.

Status: failure

## Final Response "Here are the opened issues that report bugs:\n1. [Bug] 404s, bad host, timeouts, bad urls for URLs linked from website (#15

## Captions

===============
===============Looking at the error message, I see that `filter_issues_by_label` is not defined in the available action space. I need to use the available functions to filter issues by the "bug" label.

From the current page, I can see there's a search box (bid 655) where I can enter search queries to filter issues. I should use the `search_issues` function instead, which is available in the action space.

The goal is to list all opened issues that report bugs, so I need to search for issues with the "bug" label.
===============Looking at the current page state, I can see that there are already two issues displayed with the "bug" label:
- "[Bug] 404s, bad host, timeouts, bad urls for URLs linked from website" (#15)
- "Investigate if <details>/<summary> is a good choice for our Checklist" (#28)

Both are open issues tagged with the "bug" label, which matches the goal. The search appears to have successfully filtered to show only bug-related issues. Since the goal is to list all opened issues that report bugs, and I can see the results are already displayed, I should now report this information to the user.
