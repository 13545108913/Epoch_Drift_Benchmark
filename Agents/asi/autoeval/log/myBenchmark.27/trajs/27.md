## Intent

Show me the command to clone Super_Awesome_Robot with SSH.

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information seeking task where the user wants the SSH clone command for a specific repository. The agent's action history shows it searched for the repository, clicked to navigate to the correct page, and then provided the exact SSH clone command in its response. The final state of the webpage confirms that the SSH clone URL is visible and matches what the agent sent. The agent's response contains the complete and correct information the user requested.

Status: success

## Final Response "The SSH clone command for Super_Awesome_Robot is: git clone git@localhost:convexegg/super_awesome_robot.git"

## Captions

===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. I need to find the "Super_Awesome_Robot" project and get its SSH clone command. Since I don't see "Super_Awesome_Robot" in the currently visible project list, I should search for it first.

I can see there's a search box with the description "Search or jump to…" in the accessibility tree at position [156]. This appears to be the global GitLab search functionality that can help me find the project.
===============Looking at the current page state, I can see that my previous search action was successful - the page is now showing search results for "Super_Awesome_Robot". In the accessibility tree, I can see there's a project result: "Convex Eggtart / Super_Awesome_Robot" with a heading and link at position [340] and [341]. To get the SSH clone command, I need to click on this project link to navigate to the project's main page where the clone options are typically available.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the Super_Awesome_Robot project page. I can see various elements including a "Clone" button/link at position [710] in the accessibility tree. This is likely where I can find the clone options including the SSH clone command. I should click on this "Clone" element to reveal the clone options and URLs.
===============Looking at the current page state, I can see that the "Clone" section is already expanded (expanded=True) and visible. In the accessibility tree, I can see the SSH clone URL is displayed in a textbox with the value "git@localhost:convexegg/super_awesome_robot.git" at position [717]. The user wants to see the command to clone with SSH, so I should simply send this URL to the user as it contains the complete SSH clone command they need.
