{"id": 22, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user's intent is to find out how many commits \"kilian\" made on 3/5/2023, which is an information-seeking task. The agent's action history shows it navigated to the commits page and attempted to filter by author \"kilian\", but it never applied a date filter for 3/5/2023. The final state indicates the author filter is set but not yet executed (since the search box is still focused), and there is no mention of date filtering or any commit count displayed. The bot's response is \"None\", meaning it did not provide the requested information. Therefore, the task is a failure because the agent did not retrieve or state the number of commits for the specified date.", "status": "failure"}}
