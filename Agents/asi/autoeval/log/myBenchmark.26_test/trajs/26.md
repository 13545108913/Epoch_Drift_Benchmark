## Intent

Get me my RSS feed token

## RM

Thoughts: This is an information seeking task where the user wants to obtain their RSS feed token. The agent successfully navigated to the correct page where the token is displayed, retrieved the token value "WGSbhmKxvxTLvfeB52B1" from the webpage, and provided it to the user in the response. The final state confirms the token is visible on the page, and the agent's response contains the exact information requested by the user.

Status: success

## Final Response "Your RSS feed token is: WGSbhmKxvxTLvfeB52B1"

===============
===============Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see that the current page is the Preferences page in User Settings. The navigation sidebar shows various options including "Access Tokens" at position [314]. However, the previous action failed because it was trying to navigate from a different starting point.

Since I'm already in the User Settings section (specifically in Preferences), I can directly click on the "Access Tokens" link in the sidebar to get to the RSS feed token page.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see we're already on the "Personal Access Tokens" page (as indicated by the title and URL). The RSS feed token is actually visible on this page - I can see it in the accessibility tree at element [520] with the value "WGSbhmKxvxTLvfeB52B1".

Since the goal is to get the RSS feed token and it's already displayed on the current page, I can simply retrieve it and send it to the user.
