The action history shows that the agent attempted to fill in the project name and add members, but there was an error in the final state indicating that the agent used the wrong element ID ('452') for the member search input, which should have been '455'. This error prevented the successful addition of Vinta as a member. Since the task requires both members to be added and the agent failed to correctly complete this step due to an element ID mismatch, the execution is unsuccessful.", "status": "failure"}}
