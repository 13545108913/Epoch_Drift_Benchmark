## Intent

List all opened issues that report bugs

## RM

Thoughts: The user's intent is to list all opened issues that report bugs, which is an information-seeking task. The agent performed actions to filter issues by the "bug" label and then provided a response listing the two issues found, including their numbers and titles. The final state of the webpage confirms that the search was executed and the two issues with the "bug" label are displayed. The agent's response accurately reflects the information from the webpage, so the task is successful.

Status: success

## Final Response "Found 2 opened issues that report bugs:\n\n1. #15: [Bug] 404s, bad host, timeouts, bad urls for URLs linked from website\n2. #28: Investigate if <details>/<summary> is a good choice for our Checklist"

===============Looking at the current page, I can see we're on a GitLab project page for "a11yproject.com". The goal is to list all opened issues that report bugs.

I can see in the accessibility tree that there's an "Issues" link in the project navigation sidebar with a count of "41" issues total. This is the link I need to click to navigate to the issues page where I can then filter for bug reports.

The Issues link in the project navigation has bid "350" according to the accessibility tree.
===============Looking at the error message, the click action actually succeeded - the element was found, became visible and stable, and the click was performed. The timeout error appears to be a false positive since the element was successfully clicked.

Now I need to wait for the page to load after clicking the Issues link, then I can search for bug reports. Let me wait a moment for the issues page to load completely.
===============Looking at the current page state after clicking the Issues link, I can see we're now on the Issues page. I can see multiple issues listed with various labels like "help wanted", "idea", "enhancement", "article audit", etc.

I notice one issue that has a "bug" label: issue #15 titled "[Bug] 404s, bad host, timeouts, bad urls for URLs linked from website". This confirms there are bug reports among the open issues.

To list all opened issues that report bugs, I need to filter the issues to show only those with the "bug" label. I can see there's a search box with bid "655" that allows me to search and filter issues. I'll use this to search for issues with the "bug" label.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that I've already filled the search box with "label:bug" to filter for bug reports. The search box has the value "bug" showing, which means the filter has been applied. Now I need to execute this search to see the filtered results showing only bug reports.

I can press Enter to apply the search filter and display only the issues with the "bug" label.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that the search for "label:bug" has been executed and the page is now showing filtered results. I can see two issues in the list that have the "bug" label:

1. Issue #15: "[Bug] 404s, bad host, timeouts, bad urls for URLs linked from website"
2. Issue #28: "Investigate if <details>/<summary> is a good choice for our Checklist"

Both issues are open and have the "bug" label applied. Since the goal is to list all opened issues that report bugs, I can now send this information to the user.
