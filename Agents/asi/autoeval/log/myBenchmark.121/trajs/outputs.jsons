{"id": 121, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user's intent is to create an issue in the a11yproject repo with specific details: title \"401 bad gateway\", assign to Roshanjossey, and set due date to end of 2030. The action history shows the agent performed steps to search for the repo, navigate to issues, click to create a new issue, fill in the title, and then a series of clicks that appear to be interacting with a date picker (as indicated by the final state). However, the final state only describes that the year dropdown is open and 2030 is available, but there is no confirmation that the year was actually selected, nor that the assignee was set to Roshanjossey, nor that the issue was successfully created. The bot response is \"None,\" which does not confirm completion. Since the task is content modification (creating an issue with specific attributes), and the final state does not show the issue created or the attributes set, the execution is incomplete and thus a failure.", "status": "failure"}}
