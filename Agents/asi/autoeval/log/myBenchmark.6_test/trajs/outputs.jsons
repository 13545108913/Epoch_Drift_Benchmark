{"id": 6, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "This is an information seeking task where the user wants to see issues with BUG-related labels in a specific repository. The agent performed multiple searches with different label variations (including \"BUG\" and \"bug\") but consistently found no results. The agent's response clearly communicates the search outcome and provides possible explanations for why no issues were found, which is appropriate for an information seeking task when the requested information is not available. The agent has sufficiently attempted to find the information using relevant search strategies.", "status": "success"}}
