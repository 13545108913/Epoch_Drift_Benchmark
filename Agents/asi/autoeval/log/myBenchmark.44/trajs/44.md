===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on a GitLab dashboard showing various projects. The goal is to find the top 3 contributors to "facebook's guide on building react apps" repository ranked by number of commits.

First, I need to search for this specific repository. I can see there's a search box available with bid "156" (based on the accessibility tree showing "searchbox 'Search or jump to…'").

I'll use the search functionality to find the facebook/react repository that likely contains the guide on building React apps.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that my previous search for "facebook/react" was executed but the results show "We couldn't find any projects matching facebook/react". This suggests that either the repository doesn't exist in this GitLab instance, or I need to refine my search approach.

Since the search didn't yield results, I should try a different search strategy. Let me search for just "react" to see if there are any React-related repositories that might contain the guide, or try "facebook react" to see if that yields better results.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that my previous search for "react" has returned several results, including "Meta / create-react-app" which appears to be a React-related repository from Meta (Facebook's parent company). This might be the repository containing the guide on building React apps that the user is looking for.

The "Meta / create-react-app" repository is listed in the search results with bid "371" (the link element). I should click on this repository to access its details, where I can then navigate to the contributors page to find the top contributors.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the "Meta / create-react-app" repository page. This appears to be the correct repository for Facebook's guide on building React apps.

To find the top contributors ranked by number of commits, I need to navigate to the contributors statistics page. Based on the accessibility tree, I can see there's an "Analytics" link in the sidebar with bid "419". From there, I should be able to access repository analytics and find contributor statistics.

Let me click on the Analytics link to access the repository analytics section.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see I'm now on the Analytics page for the create-react-app repository. The accessibility tree shows that under the Analytics section, there's a "Repository" link with bid "419" that I previously clicked, and now I need to navigate to the contributors statistics specifically.

From the tree, I can see there's a "Repository" link under Analytics (bid "419") and within that section, there should be a "Contributors" option. However, the current tree doesn't show the contributors link directly visible. I need to first click on the Repository analytics section to access the contributor statistics.

Let me click on the Repository link within Analytics to access the repository analytics where I should find contributor statistics.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see I'm on the Repository Analytics page for the create-react-app repository. The accessibility tree shows various analytics sections like programming languages, code coverage, and commit statistics, but I don't see a direct link to contributor statistics.

However, I notice there's a "Commit statistics" section that shows "Total: 822 commits" and "Authors: 259". This suggests the contributor data might be available on this page, but I need to find where the individual contributor information with commit counts is displayed.

Let me scroll down to see if there's more content below the current view that might contain the contributor list.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the Repository Analytics page which shows commit statistics but doesn't directly display the list of individual contributors with their commit counts. The page shows there are 259 authors with 822 total commits, but I need to find the specific top 3 contributors by commit count.

Based on the accessibility tree, I notice there's a navigation sidebar with various sections. Under the "Analytics" section (bid "407"), there might be additional options that aren't fully expanded in the current view. Let me check if there's a "Contributors" link specifically that I might have missed.

Let me click on the main "Analytics" link again to see if it expands to show more options, including a Contributors section.
===============Looking at the current situation, I've been trying to navigate to the contributors page but haven't found it yet. I'm currently on the Repository Analytics page which shows commit statistics but not the individual contributor breakdown.

The accessibility tree shows that under the "Analytics" section in the sidebar, there's a nested list with options including "CI/CD", "Repository", and "Value Stream". I've already clicked "Repository" (bid "419") which brought me to the current page.

Since I need contributor statistics specifically, I should look for a "Contributors" link. In GitLab, contributor statistics are typically found under the Repository section, but I might need to navigate to a different part of the interface. Let me try clicking on the main "Repository" link in the sidebar (not under Analytics) to access the main repository view where contributor information might be more accessible.
===============Looking at the current situation, I realize I've been navigating through the Analytics section but haven't found the direct contributors list. The goal is to find the top 3 contributors by commit count to the create-react-app repository.

Based on the accessibility tree from earlier views, I noticed there was a "Contributors" link directly under the "Repository" section in the sidebar navigation (bid "335"). This is likely the direct path to the contributor statistics I need, rather than going through Analytics.

Let me navigate directly to the Contributors page using the sidebar navigation.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the Contributors page for the create-react-app repository. The accessibility tree shows a list of contributors with their names and commit counts, starting with "Dan Abramov" who has 355 commits, followed by "Ville Immonen" with 49 commits, and "Joe Haddad" with 34 commits.

Since the goal is to list the top 3 contributors ranked by number of commits, I can now see this information clearly displayed on the page. I should extract this information and send it to the user.
