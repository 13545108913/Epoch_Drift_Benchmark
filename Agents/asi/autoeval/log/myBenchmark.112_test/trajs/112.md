## Intent

Add the following users to repo a11y-webring.club as developer: ['abisubramanya27', 'lahwaacz']

## RM

Thoughts: The user's intent is to add two users as developers to the repo a11y-webring.club, which is a content modification task. The action history shows the agent navigated to the repo members page and then checked the users' roles and notified them, but there is no action to actually add the users as developers. The final state of the webpage is empty, indicating no changes were made. Since the users were not added, the task has failed.

Status: failure
