The agent performed a search with the exact label \"flaky-test\" which returned no results. The agent correctly informed the user about the search result and provided possible explanations (no issues with this label or different naming convention). Since the agent successfully executed the search and provided an informative response about the outcome, the task is completed successfully even though no issues were found.", "status": "success"}}
{"id": 5, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user's intent is to display issues in the keycloak/keycloak repository with flaky-test labels, which is an information-seeking task. The agent attempted to search for the repository but could not find it in the current GitLab instance, as indicated by the action history and final state. The agent then reported the task as infeasible, which is an appropriate response when the required information is not available. Since the agent explicitly stated the reason (repository not found) and did not provide the requested information due to unavailability, this constitutes a valid response for an information-seeking task under the given constraints.", "status": "success"}}
