## Intent

Submit a merge request for a11yproject.com/redesign branch to be merged into markdown-figure-block branch, assign myself as the reviewer

## RM

Thoughts: The user's intent is to submit a merge request for the "a11yproject.com/redesign" branch to be merged into the "markdown-figure-block" branch, and assign themselves as the reviewer. This is a content modification task, so I need to examine the action history and final state to determine success. The action history shows steps to search for the repository, navigate to the merge request creation page, select the source branch ("redesign"), and start selecting the target branch ("markdown-figure-block"). However, the final state indicates that the target branch selection is still in progress—the dropdown is open with the branch list visible, but no selection has been made yet. The merge request has not been submitted, and there is no indication that the user has been assigned as the reviewer. Since the task is incomplete, it is a failure.

Status: failure

## Final Response 

## Captions

===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing projects. I need to find the "a11yproject.com" repository first, then navigate to create a merge request from the "redesign" branch to the "markdown-figure-block" branch, and assign myself as reviewer.

From the project list, I can see several repositories but I don't see "a11yproject.com" in the visible list. I should search for it first.

I can see there's a search box with ID '156' in the navigation bar that says "Search or jump to…". This would be the appropriate place to search for the repository.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on a search results page for "a11yproject.com" and there's a visible project result for "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com". The search has already been performed, so I don't need to search again. I should click on this project link to navigate to the repository page where I can create the merge request.

The project link appears to be element with bid '338' based on the accessibility tree showing "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" as a link.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the a11yproject.com repository page. I need to navigate to the merge requests section to create a new merge request. From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a "Merge requests" link in the project navigation sidebar with bid '374' that shows "Merge requests" and has a count of "0". This is where I need to go to create the merge request.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the Merge Requests page for the a11yproject.com repository. The page shows there are currently 0 merge requests and has a "New merge request" link with bid '586'. Since I need to create a new merge request from the "redesign" branch to the "markdown-figure-block" branch, I should click this link to start the merge request creation process.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the "New merge request" page. The accessibility tree shows the form is already loaded with source and target branch selection fields. I need to:

1. Select "redesign" as the source branch
2. Select "markdown-figure-block" as the target branch
3. Continue to the next step where I can assign myself as reviewer

I can see there's a "Select source branch" button with bid '616' and a target branch dropdown showing "add-color-utility-classes" with bid '660'. I should first click the source branch selector to choose the "redesign" branch.
===============Looking at the current page state, I can see that after clicking the source branch selector, a dropdown menu has appeared with a search box (bid '625') that's already focused, and a list of available branches including "redesign" (bid '736'). Since the search box is focused, I can simply type "redesign" to filter the branches and then select it.
===============Looking at the current page state, I can see that the search box (bid '625') already has "redesign" as its value, and the branch list shows "redesign" as an available option (bid '736'). Since the search has already filtered to show the "redesign" branch, I now need to click on it to select it as the source branch.
===============Looking at the current page state, I can see that after filling the search box with "redesign", the branch list shows "redesign" as an available option. However, the accessibility tree shows the branch list item has bid '738' (not '736') with a link inside it that has bid '739'. I should click on the actual branch link to select it.
===============Looking at the current page state, I can see that I successfully selected "redesign" as the source branch. Now I need to select "markdown-figure-block" as the target branch. I can see there's a target branch selector button with bid '660' that currently shows "add-color-utility-classes". I need to click this to change it to "markdown-figure-block".
===============Looking at the current page state, I can see that after clicking the target branch selector (bid '660'), a dropdown has appeared with a search box (bid '669') that's already focused, and a list of available branches including "feature/markdown-figure-block" (bid '766'). I need to search for and select the "markdown-figure-block" branch.
