## Intent

List the name of the top 3 contributors to facebook's guide on building react apps repo, ranked by the number of commits?

## RM

Thoughts: The user's intent is to list the top 3 contributors to "facebook's guide on building react apps repo" (likely referring to the create-react-app repository), ranked by number of commits. The agent's action history shows it navigated to the contributors page and then provided a response. However, the bot's response is incomplete—it only lists the first contributor (Dan Abramov) and cuts off mid-sentence, failing to include the other two contributors. The final state of the webpage confirms the top 3 contributors are visible, but the agent's response does not fully convey this information. Since this is an information-seeking task, the response must contain the complete requested information, which it does not.

Status: failure

## Final Response "The top 3 contributors to facebook's create-react-app repository, ranked by number of commits, are:\n1. Dan Abramov (355 commits

===============Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the create-react-app repository page, not the react repository. The goal is to find the top 3 contributors to "facebook's guide on building react apps" which appears to be this create-react-app repository.

I need to navigate to the contributors page to see commit statistics. From the accessibility tree, I can see there's an "Analytics" link in the sidebar with bid "419", but the previous action failed to find it. Let me look for alternative ways to access contributor statistics.

I notice there's a "826 Commits" link in the navigation area with bid "602". This might lead to commit history where I can find contributor information. Let me try clicking that first.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the create-react-app repository's commits page for the 0.9.x branch. The goal is to find the top 3 contributors ranked by number of commits.

From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a "Contributors" link in the sidebar navigation with bid "325" under the Repository section. This should take us directly to the contributors statistics page where we can see commit counts per contributor.

Let me click on the Contributors link to access the contributor statistics.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see we're now on the Contributors page for the create-react-app repository. The accessibility tree shows multiple contributor entries with their commit counts. I can see the top contributors listed with their commit numbers:

- Dan Abramov: 355 commits
- Ville Immonen: 49 commits
- Joe Haddad: 34 commits
- Christopher Chedeau: 25 commits
- And many others with fewer commits

The top 3 contributors by number of commits are clearly visible:
1. Dan Abramov (355 commits)
2. Ville Immonen (49 commits)
3. Joe Haddad (34 commits)

I now have the information needed to answer the user's question.
