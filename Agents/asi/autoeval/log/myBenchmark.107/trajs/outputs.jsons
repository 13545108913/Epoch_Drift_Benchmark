The action history shows the agent attempted to search for \"Jakub Klinkovsk\" and clicked some elements, then started a search for \"convexegg\" but encountered a \"Loading...\" state. The agent performed multiple noop (no operation) actions and pressed Enter, but the final state indicates the search for \"convexegg\" is still loading and not completed. Since the task requires following five users, and the agent only managed to initiate searches for two (with the second one stuck), it did not successfully navigate to or follow any of the users. Therefore, the task is not completed.", "status": "failure"}}
