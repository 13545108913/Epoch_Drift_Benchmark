{"id": 143, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user's intent is to start a private project named \"AGISite\" with a JEKYLL template and add Rohan and Vinta as members. The action history shows the agent successfully created the project \"AGISite\" (actions 1-6) and began adding members by searching for \"Rohan\" (actions 7-10). However, the final state indicates that \"Rohan Kumar @Seirdy\" appears in search results, but the agent only pressed Enter after filling \"Rohan\" without confirming if this selected the correct user or adding Vinta. Since the task requires adding both Rohan and Vinta as members, and the action history stops after initiating the search for Rohan without completing the addition or addressing Vinta, the task is incomplete and thus a failure.", "status": "failure"}}
