## Intent

List the name of the top 3 contributors to prime/design repo, ranked by the number of commits?

## RM

Thoughts: The user's intent is information seeking, specifically to list the names of the top 3 contributors ranked by number of commits. The agent's action history shows navigation to a contributors page, and the final state confirms the page displays contributors in order by commit count, with the top 3 clearly visible. The bot's response correctly lists the top 3 contributors with their names and commit counts, matching the information in the final state. Therefore, the task is successfully completed.

Status: success

## Final Response "The top 3 contributors to the Primer/design repository by number of commits are:\n1. Shawn Allen (95 commits

## Captions

===============Looking at the current page, I can see a list of projects including "Primer / design" which matches the repository name in the goal. I need to click on this project link to navigate to its repository page where I can find contributor information.

The "Primer / design" project link has the bid "612" according to the accessibility tree.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the Primer/design repository page. The goal is to list the top 3 contributors by number of commits. I need to navigate to the contributors statistics page, which is typically found under the Analytics or Repository sections.

From the accessibility tree, I can see there's an "Analytics" link in the sidebar with bid "456". This should lead to a page where I can find contributor statistics.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the Value Stream Analytics page for the Primer/design repository. The goal is to find the top 3 contributors by number of commits, which requires accessing repository statistics. The contributors information is typically found under the Repository analytics section, not the Value Stream Analytics where I currently am.

From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a "Repository" link under the Analytics section in the sidebar with bid "458". This should navigate me to the Repository analytics page where I can find contributor statistics.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the Repository Analytics page for the Primer/design repository. The goal is to list the top 3 contributors by number of commits. The current page shows commit statistics for a specific branch "a11y/context-menu-accessibility-docs" but doesn't show the contributor leaderboard.

I need to find the contributors section, which is typically available in repository analytics. From the accessibility tree, I can see various statistics sections but no direct contributors list. I should look for a "Contributors" link or tab that would show the top contributors ranked by commits.

Let me scroll down to see if there are more sections below the current commit statistics, or look for navigation elements that might lead to contributors data.
===============Looking at the current page state, I can see I'm on the Repository Analytics page but I'm viewing statistics for a specific branch "a11y/context-menu-accessibility-docs". The page shows commit statistics but not the contributor leaderboard that would show the top contributors by number of commits.

From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a branch selector button with bid "588" that currently shows "a11y/context-menu-accessibility-docs". I need to change this to view statistics for the entire repository (likely the default branch like "main" or "master") to see overall contributor statistics across all branches.

Let me click on this branch selector to change the view to the main repository statistics where I should be able to find contributor information.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that after clicking the branch selector (bid "588"), a dropdown menu has appeared with various branch options. The goal is to find the top 3 contributors by number of commits, which requires viewing repository-wide statistics rather than statistics for a specific branch.

From the accessibility tree, I can see the dropdown shows a list of branches including "main" (bid "656"), which is likely the default branch that would show overall repository statistics including all contributors. I should select the "main" branch to view the repository-wide analytics where contributor information should be available.
===============Looking at the current page state after selecting the "main" branch, I can see I'm now on the Repository Analytics page for the main branch. The page shows various commit statistics including total commits (800), authors (71), and various charts, but I don't see a direct contributors leaderboard showing individual contributor names and their commit counts.

The goal requires listing the top 3 contributors by number of commits. Since the current page doesn't show this information directly, I need to find a different section or page that displays contributor statistics. Typically, GitLab has a dedicated "Contributors" page that shows this information ranked by commit count.

From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a navigation sidebar with various repository sections. I should look for a "Contributors" link or navigate to a different analytics view that shows individual contributor statistics.

Let me check if there are other navigation options in the Repository analytics section that might lead to contributor data.
===============Looking at the current situation, I can see I'm stuck in a loop where I keep returning to the same Repository Analytics page that doesn't show the individual contributor leaderboard I need. The page shows aggregate statistics (800 total commits, 71 authors) but doesn't list individual contributors ranked by commit count.

From the accessibility tree, I notice there's a "Repository" link in the main navigation sidebar (bid "307") that might lead to a different repository view where contributor information is available. The Repository page typically has a "Contributors" section that shows exactly what I need - individual contributors ranked by number of commits.

Let me navigate to the main Repository page instead of staying in the Analytics section.
===============Looking at the current situation, I can see I've been navigating through analytics pages but haven't found the direct contributor leaderboard. The goal is to list the top 3 contributors by number of commits, which is typically found on a dedicated "Contributors" page in the repository section.

From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a "Contributors" link in the repository navigation sidebar with bid "339". This should take me directly to a page that shows all contributors ranked by their commit counts, which is exactly what I need to answer the user's question.
===============Looking at the current page state, I can see I'm now on the Contributors page for the Primer/design repository. The page shows a list of contributors with their names and commit counts, which is exactly what I need to answer the user's question.

From the accessibility tree, I can see the contributors are listed in order with their commit counts:
- Shawn Allen: 95 commits
- Inayaili León: 77 commits
- Aurora Pleguezuelo: 66 commits
- Joshua Shao: 54 commits
- And so on...

The top 3 contributors by number of commits are clearly displayed. I can now extract this information and send it to the user.
