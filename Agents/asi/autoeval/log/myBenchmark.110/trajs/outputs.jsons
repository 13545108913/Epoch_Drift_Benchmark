{"id": 110, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user's intent is to invite two collaborators (Beno\u00eet and Abishek) to a repository, which is a content modification task. The action history shows that the agent attempted to fill in names and select roles, but there is a critical error: for \"Beno\u00eet\", the agent filled bid \"604\" (which is a label, not the input field) and then clicked \"787\" (likely an \"Invite\" or similar button), but without using the correct input field (bid \"609\"), the invitation for Beno\u00eet likely failed. For \"Abishek\", the agent correctly filled bid \"609\" but did not complete the role selection or invitation step (no click after filling). The final state indicates the agent recognized the error but did not correct it in the actions taken. Since the task requires both collaborators to be invited and the actions are incomplete/incorrect, the execution fails.", "status": "failure"}}
