## Intent

Submit a merge request for the branch that implements the support of template strings to be merged into master branch, assign myself and Roshan as the reviewer

## RM

Thoughts: The user's intent is to submit a merge request for a specific branch, which falls under the "Content modification" task type. The agent's action history shows it attempted to search for the branch but could not find it, leading to a report of infeasibility. The final state confirms the branch is not available, and the agent did not proceed to create a merge request or assign reviewers. Since the necessary branch is missing, the agent cannot complete the task, making this a failure.

Status: failure

## Final Response

===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab repository page for a11yproject.com. The goal is to submit a merge request for a branch that implements template strings support to be merged into master, and assign myself and Roshan as reviewers.

First, I need to navigate to the merge requests section since I'm currently on the repository files view. I can see there's a "Merge requests" link in the left sidebar navigation with the label showing "0" merge requests.

Let me click on the "Merge requests" link in the sidebar to navigate to the merge requests page where I can create a new merge request.<｜end▁of▁thinking｜>Based on the accessibility tree, I can see there's a "Merge requests" link in the left sidebar navigation (complementary section) with bid 374. This should take me to the merge requests page where I can create a new merge request for the branch that implements template strings support.
===============Looking at the current page state, I can see I'm already on the Merge requests page (the active tab shows "Merge requests · The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com · GitLab" and the main content area shows information about merge requests).

I can see there's a "New merge request" link with bid 586 in the main content area. Since I need to submit a new merge request for the branch that implements template strings support, I should click this link to start creating the merge request.
===============Looking at the current page state, I can see I'm already on the "New merge request" page (the active tab title confirms this). The accessibility tree shows the form is loaded with:

- Source branch selection (currently showing "Select source branch")
- Target branch selection (currently showing "add-color-utility-classes")
- A "Compare branches and continue" button

To accomplish the goal, I need to:
1. Select the source branch that implements template strings support
2. Ensure target branch is "master"
3. Fill in the merge request details
4. Assign myself and Roshan as reviewers

The first step is to select the source branch. I can see there's a "Select source branch" button with bid 616 that I need to click to choose the branch with template strings implementation.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that after clicking the "Select source branch" button, a dropdown has opened with a search box (bid 625) that's currently focused, and a list of available branches below it. I need to find and select the branch that implements template strings support.

Since I don't see an obvious branch name like "template-strings" or similar in the visible list, I should search for it. The search box is already focused, so I can type to search for branches related to template strings.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that I've searched for "template" in the branch search box, but the accessibility tree shows "No matching results" in the list below. This suggests that either:

1. The branch with template strings support has a different name
2. The branch doesn't exist yet
3. There might be a typo in the branch name

Since the search didn't find any branches with "template" in the name, I should try searching for broader terms or check if there are other branches available. Let me first clear the search to see all available branches, then I can look for any branch that might contain the template strings implementation.
===============Looking at the error and the current state, I need to clear the search field to see all available branches. The error suggests there was an issue with the previous action, but I should still proceed with clearing the search to view all branches.

The search box (bid 625) is currently focused with "template" as the value. I'll clear it by selecting all text and deleting it, then press Enter to refresh the branch list.
===============Looking at the current situation, I've cleared the search for branches but I'm still not seeing the branch that implements template strings support. The accessibility tree shows "No matching results" even after clearing the search, which suggests there might be an issue with the branch list loading or there are no branches available besides the current target branch "add-color-utility-classes".

Since I cannot find the branch with template strings support through the search interface, I should report this issue to the user. The goal requires submitting a merge request for a specific branch, but that branch doesn't appear to be available in the current repository.
