{"id": 134, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user's intent is to create a new private project named \"planner\" and add Abishek and Vinta as members. This is a content modification task. The action history shows the agent attempted to create the project (actions 1-3) and add members (actions 4-10). However, the final state indicates an error: the agent incorrectly used element \"452\" (a `<ul>`) instead of the correct search textbox \"455\" for adding \"Vinta\". This suggests the agent failed to properly add Vinta as a member due to using the wrong element ID, and the final state reflects an error message rather than successful completion. Since the task requires both members to be added and the agent encountered an error, the execution is unsuccessful.", "status": "failure"}}
