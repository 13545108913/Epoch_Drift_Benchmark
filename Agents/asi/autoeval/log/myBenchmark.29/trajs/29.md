## Intent

Show me the command to clone metaseq with SSH.

## RM

Thoughts: The user's intent is information seeking, specifically to obtain the command to clone the "metaseq" repository using SSH. The agent's action history shows it searched for the project and repository, clicked to navigate to the correct page, and then clicked to expand the clone options. The final state of the webpage confirms that the SSH clone URL is visible and correctly displayed as "git@localhost:root/metaseq.git". The agent's response to the user includes the complete and correct command "git clone git@localhost:root/metaseq.git", which matches the information available on the page and fulfills the user's request.

Status: success

## Final Response "The command to clone metaseq with SSH is: git clone git@localhost:root/metaseq.git"

## Captions

===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on a GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. The user wants to see the command to clone "metaseq" with SSH. I need to first find the metaseq project in this list.

I can see there's a search box with the description "Filter by name..." which would be perfect for finding the metaseq project. Once I find it, I can click on it to get to the project page where I can find the SSH clone URL.

Let me use the search functionality to find the metaseq project.
===============Looking at the current page state after searching for "metaseq", I can see the search box already has "metaseq" as its value, but the results show "This user doesn't have any personal projects" which suggests the search didn't find the metaseq project. However, since the user specifically asked about cloning metaseq with SSH, I should try to find the project through other means.

Let me try using the main search bar at the top of the page instead of the project filter search box, as it might search across all projects in the GitLab instance.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that the search results show one project matching "metaseq" - specifically "Administrator / metaseq" with the description "Repo for external large-scale work". This appears to be the correct project. I need to click on this project link to navigate to the project page where I can find the SSH clone command.

The project link has the text "Administrator / metaseq" and appears to be a heading link. I should click on this link to access the project repository page.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the metaseq project page in GitLab. The user wants to see the command to clone metaseq with SSH. On GitLab project pages, the clone URL is typically found in a "Clone" button or section. I can see there's a "Clone" link with bid 714 in the accessibility tree. I should click on this to reveal the clone options, including the SSH clone command.
===============Looking at the current page state, I can see that the "Clone" button has already been clicked and is expanded (shown as "expanded=True" in the accessibility tree). The clone options are now visible, including the SSH clone URL which is displayed in a textbox with the value "git@localhost:root/metaseq.git".

Since the user wants to see the command to clone metaseq with SSH, I can simply send them the SSH clone command that's now visible on the page.
