{"id": 136, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user's intent is to create a new public project named \"AutoAGI\" and add \"primer\" as members. The action history shows the agent filled in the project name \"AutoAGI\" and performed a series of clicks, including searching for \"primer\" and selecting it. However, the final state indicates that \"Primer\" has been selected but no role has been assigned yet, and the user has not been added to the project. The agent's response is \"None,\" which does not confirm completion. Since the task is content modification (creating a project and adding members), I examine the action history and final state: the project creation may have been initiated, but adding \"primer\" as a member is incomplete, as the role assignment and final addition steps are not confirmed as done. Thus, the task is not successfully completed.", "status": "failure"}}
