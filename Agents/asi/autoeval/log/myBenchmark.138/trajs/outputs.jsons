This is a content modification task, so I need to examine the action history and final state of the webpage to determine success. The action history shows that the agent attempted to create the project and add members, but there was an error in filling the member search field (using bid \"452\" instead of \"455\" for convexegg). The final state indicates that the agent recognized the error but did not complete adding convexegg or abishek. Since the task requires adding all three members and the actions were incomplete due to the error, the task was not successfully completed.", "status": "failure"}}
{"id": 138, "eval_info": {"thoughts": "The user's intent is to create a new private project named \"llm_bulk_inference\" and add specific members (primer, convexegg, abishek). The action history shows the agent navigated to the project creation page, filled in the project name, and selected private visibility, but stopped before clicking \"Create project\" and did not proceed to add any members. Since the task requires both creating the project and adding members, and the agent's actions are incomplete (missing the final creation step and all member addition steps), the task is not successfully completed.", "status": "failure"}}
