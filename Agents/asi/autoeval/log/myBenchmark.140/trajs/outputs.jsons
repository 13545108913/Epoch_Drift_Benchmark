The action history shows that the agent successfully created the project (actions 1-6) and started the member addition process. However, only \"primer\" was selected for addition (action 9), and the confirmation (action 10) was attempted, but the final state indicates that the \"Add to project\" button is still available, meaning the addition was not completed. Furthermore, the agent did not add \"convexegg\" or \"abishek\" at all. Since the task requires adding all three members and the final state shows incomplete actions, the execution is unsuccessful.", "status": "failure"}}
