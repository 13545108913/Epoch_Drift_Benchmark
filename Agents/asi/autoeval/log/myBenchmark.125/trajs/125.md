## Captions

===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing projects. I need to find the "aem-hacker" project to open an issue about the "OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use" error.

First, I should search for the "aem-hacker" project using the search functionality. I can see there's a search box available with bid '156' that says "Search or jump to…".
===============Looking at the current page, I can see that the search for "aem-hacker" has already been performed and the project "0ang3el / aem-hacker" is displayed in the search results. Now I need to click on this project link to navigate to the project page where I can create a new issue.

From the accessibility tree, I can see the project link has the bid '338' (the link for "0ang3el / aem-hacker").
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the "aem-hacker" project page. The accessibility tree shows I'm on the project's main page with various navigation options available. I need to navigate to the Issues section to create a new issue about the "OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use" error.

From the accessibility tree, I can see there's an "Issues" link in the project navigation sidebar with bid '343'. This should take me to the issues page where I can create a new issue.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the Issues page for the aem-hacker project. I can see there are already several issues listed, including some that appear to be related to the same "OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use" error (issues #1, #15, and #16).

To accomplish the goal of opening a new issue to report this error, I need to click the "New issue" button/link. From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a "New issue" link with bid '528'.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the "New Issue" page for the aem-hacker project. The form is already loaded with the title field focused (bid '513'), a description field (bid '585'), and a "Create issue" button (bid '629') that is currently disabled.

To create the issue about the "OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use" error, I need to:
1. Fill in the title field with a descriptive title about the error
2. Fill in the description field with details about experiencing this error during executions
3. Click the "Create issue" button once it becomes enabled

The title field is already focused, so I'll start by filling it with an appropriate title.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see the title field has been filled with "OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use during executions". Now I need to fill in the description field with details about experiencing this error during executions in aem-hacker. The description field has bid '585'.
===============Looking at the current page, I can see that both the title and description fields have been filled with appropriate content about the "OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use" issue. The form appears to be complete, and I can now click the "Create issue" button to submit the new issue. The "Create issue" button has bid '629'.
===============Looking at the error message, the click action on the "Create issue" button (bid '629') timed out, but the log shows the element was found, visible, enabled, stable, and the click was performed. The timeout might be due to waiting for navigation after the click. Since the click action was actually performed according to the log, I should wait a moment to see if the page navigates to the newly created issue page, or check if the issue was created successfully.

Let me wait a bit to allow any page navigation to complete, then check the current page state.
===============Looking at the current state, I can see that I'm now on an issue page titled "OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use during executions (#17)" which indicates that the issue was successfully created and assigned issue number #17. The page shows the issue details including the title, description, status (Open), creation time, and author (Byte Blaze). This confirms that the goal has been accomplished - I've successfully opened an issue to report experiencing "OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use" during executions in aem-hacker.

Since the issue has been created successfully, I should notify the user that the task has been completed.
