Looking at the current page, I can see the GitLab dashboard with a list of projects. I need to find the "a11yproject.com" repository to invite collaborators. I can see it in the project list as "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" with a link to `http://172.26.116.102:8080/a11yproject/a11yproject.com`. I should click on this link to navigate to the project page where I can manage collaborators.

```click("465")```

Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see I'm already on the a11yproject.com project page (URL shows `http://172.26.116.102:8080/a11yproject/a11yproject.com`). To invite collaborators, I need to access the project settings where member management is typically located. I can see a "Settings" link in the sidebar with bid 395 that should lead to the project settings page where I can manage collaborators.

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the Members page for the a11yproject.com repository (URL shows `http://172.26.116.102:8080/a11yproject/a11yproject.com/-/project_members`). The page shows the "Invite member" section where I can search for users to invite. I need to:

1. First, search for "Abishek" in the member search field (bid 490)
2. Then select the appropriate role for them
3. Repeat for "Vinta"

The "Add to project" button is currently disabled (bid 512), which means I need to first search for and select members before I can add them. Let me start by searching for Abishek.

```fill("490", "Abishek")```

Looking at the current page, I can see that after filling "Abishek" in the search field, there's now a dropdown list with an option for "Abishek S @abisubramanya27" (bid 658). This appears to be the search result for Abishek. To select this user and enable the "Add to project" button, I need to click on this option from the dropdown.

Looking at the current state, I can see that I successfully searched for "Abishek" and the dropdown appeared with "Abishek S @abisubramanya27" (bid 658). After clicking on this option, the user should now be selected in the "Select members to invite" field. 

Now I need to:
1. Set the appropriate role permission (currently set to "Guest" by default)
2. Search for and add "Vinta" as the second collaborator
3. Click "Add to project" to complete the invitation

Since I need to invite both Abishek and Vinta, I should first search for Vinta while Abishek is already selected. Let me search for Vinta in the same search field.

```fill("490", "Vinta")```

Now I need to set the appropriate role permission for both collaborators and then click the "Add to project" button to complete the invitation process. The role permission is currently set to "Guest" by default (bid 498), which might be appropriate, but I should confirm this is the desired role level before proceeding with the invitation.
