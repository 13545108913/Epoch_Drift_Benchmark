Looking at the goal to find the number of commits of the contributor with the most commits to branch main, I can see from the accessibility tree that there's a link showing "1,636 Commits" for the master branch. However, this shows the total number of commits to the branch, not the breakdown by contributor.

To find the contributor with the most commits, I need to navigate to the commit history page where contributor statistics are typically available. I can see there's a "History" link that likely leads to the commit history page.

Let me click on the "History" link to access the commit history where I should be able to see contributor statistics.

```click('587')```

Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the commits page for the master branch, but I need to find contributor statistics to determine who has the most commits. I notice in the accessibility tree there's a "Contributors" link under the Repository section (with ID 270) that should take us to a page showing contributor statistics with commit counts.

Let me navigate to the Contributors page where I can see the breakdown of commits by contributor.

```click('270')```

Looking at the current page, I can see we're already on the Contributors page (as indicated by the URL ending with "/-/graphs/master" and the page title "Contributors"). The accessibility tree shows a list of contributors with their commit counts. The first contributor listed is "Vinta Chen" with "414 commits", which appears to be the highest number among all the contributors shown in the list.

Since we're already on the correct page and can see the contributor statistics, I can now provide the answer to the user.

```send_msg_to_user("The contributor with the most commits to the main branch is Vinta Chen with 414 commits.")```
