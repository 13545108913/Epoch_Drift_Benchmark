Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing various projects, but I don't see the thoughtbot/administrate project listed. I need to search for this specific project first before I can check its commit statistics.

I can see there's a search box with bid 142 that allows me to search for projects. I'll use this to find the thoughtbot/administrate project.

```search_project('142', 'thoughtbot/administrate')```

Looking at the current page, I can see that my previous search for "thoughtbot/administrate" has already been executed, as evidenced by the search box showing "thoughtbot/administrate" as the current value. However, the search results show "We couldn't find any results matching thoughtbot/administrate" and there are 0 projects found. This suggests the project might not exist in this GitLab instance or I need to navigate to a different section.

Let me try clicking on the "Projects" link in the search results to see if I can find the project through a different approach, or perhaps I need to navigate to the main projects page first.

```click("253")```

Looking at the current state, my previous search for "thoughtbot/administrate" returned no results, showing "We couldn't find any results matching thoughtbot/administrate" and 0 projects found. The search was already executed but didn't find the project. 

Since the project doesn't appear to exist in this GitLab instance, I should inform the user that I cannot proceed with finding commit statistics for a project that doesn't exist here.

```send_msg_to_user("I searched for the thoughtbot/administrate project in this GitLab instance, but it appears this project does not exist here. I cannot retrieve commit statistics for a project that isn't available in this environment.")```
