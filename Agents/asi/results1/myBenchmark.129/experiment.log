Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the project details page for the "design" repository under the "Primer" group. To submit a merge request for the "dialog-component" branch to be merged into "bump-doctocat" branch, I need to navigate to the Merge Requests section first.

I can see there's a "Merge Requests" link in the sidebar with the text "Merge Requests 144". This is exactly what I need to click to get to the merge requests page where I can create a new merge request.

```click("306")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the Merge Requests page for the Primer/design project (as indicated by the URL and page title). Since I need to create a new merge request for the dialog-component branch to be merged into bump-doctocat branch, I should click the "New merge request" button/link that I can see in the accessibility tree.

I can see there's a link with the text "New merge request" and bid "452" in the accessibility tree. This is exactly what I need to click to start creating a new merge request.

```click("452")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the "New Merge Request" page for the Primer/design project. The accessibility tree shows:

- Source branch is currently set to "primer/design" (bid 444)
- There's a "Select source branch" button (bid 462)
- Target branch is currently set to "a11y/context-menu-accessibility-docs" (bid 505)

To create the merge request as specified in the goal, I need to:
1. Change the source branch to "dialog-component"
2. Change the target branch to "bump-doctocat"
3. Continue with creating the merge request

The first step is to click the "Select source branch" button to change the source branch from the current selection to "dialog-component".

```click("462")```

Since the searchbox is already focused, I can simply type "dialog-component" to filter the branches and then select it.

```fill("471", "dialog-component")```
