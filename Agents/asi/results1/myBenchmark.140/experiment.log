Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab Projects dashboard. To accomplish the goal of creating a private project with Android template and adding members, I need to first navigate to the "New project" page. I can see there's a "New project" link available in the accessibility tree.

The next logical step is to click on the "New project" link to start the project creation process.

```click("223")```

Looking at the current page state, I can see I'm already on the "New Project" page (URL: http://172.26.116.102:8080/projects/new). The accessibility tree shows I'm on the tabpanel for creating a blank project, but I need to use an Android template instead.

I can see there are three tabs available:
- Blank project (currently selected)
- Create from template 
- Import project

I need to click on the "Create from template" tab to access the Android template.

```click("242")```

Looking at the current state, I can see I'm on the "Create from template" tab (tab 242 is focused and selected). The accessibility tree shows various project templates including Android, which is exactly what I need for the goal.

I can see the Android template with:
- Image element [385]
- Strong text "Android" [387]
- Description "A ready-to-go template for use with Android apps."
- Radio button [393] labeled "Use template"

To select the Android template, I need to click the radio button associated with it.

```click("393")```

Looking at the error message, I can see that the radio button with bid "393" is being intercepted by other elements on the page. The error shows that both a span element (bid "394") and a help dropdown (bid "174") are intercepting pointer events, preventing the click from reaching the radio button.

Since the radio button itself is difficult to click directly due to these overlapping elements, I should try clicking on the label text "Use template" instead, which should also select the radio button. The label has bid "392" according to the accessibility tree.

```click("392")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I successfully selected the Android template by clicking the "Use template" label. Now I need to fill in the project details to create the project. 

From the accessibility tree, I can see:
- Project name textbox (bid "543") is focused and currently shows "My awesome project"
- Project slug textbox (bid "554") shows "my-awesome-project"
- Private radio button (bid "566") is already checked, which matches our goal for a private project

I need to change the project name to "web_agent_android_xl" as specified in the goal. The project name field is already focused, so I can directly fill it with the new name.

```fill("543", "web_agent_android_xl")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I successfully filled the project name with "web_agent_android_xl" and the Android template is selected. The project is already set to private (radio button 566 is checked), which matches the goal requirements. 

Now I need to create the project by clicking the "Create project" button, which has bid "586" according to the accessibility tree. After creating the project, I can then navigate to the project settings to add the specified members (primer, convexegg, abishek).

```click("586")```

To accomplish the next part of the goal (adding members primer, convexegg, abishek), I need to navigate to the project settings and then to the members management section. I can see there's a "Settings" link in the sidebar with bid "395".

The logical next step is to click on the Settings link to access the project settings where I can manage members.

I can see in the sidebar navigation that there's a "Members" link with bid "407" under the Settings section. This is exactly where I need to go to manage project members.

The next logical step is to click on the "Members" link to access the member management interface.

- A search box for selecting members to invite (bid "490")
- A role permission dropdown (bid "498") currently set to "Guest"
- An "Add to project" button (bid "512") currently disabled

I need to add three members: primer, convexegg, and abishek. I can use the available `add_user_with_role` function to search for each user and add them with appropriate roles. Since no specific roles were mentioned in the goal, I'll use the default "Guest" role.

I'll start by adding the first user "primer" using the search box and role dropdown.

```add_user_with_role("490", "primer", "498", "Guest")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the `add_user_with_role` function was executed to add "primer" as a member. The accessibility tree shows that "Primer @primer" now appears in the status area (bid "603"), indicating the user was successfully found and selected. However, the "Add to project" button (bid "512") is still available, suggesting I need to confirm the addition.

The function `add_user_with_role` only searches and selects the user and role, but doesn't actually add them to the project. I need to click the "Add to project" button to complete the member addition for primer.

After adding primer, I'll need to repeat the process for convexegg and abishek.

```confirm_member_addition("512")```
