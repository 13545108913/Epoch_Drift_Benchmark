Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on a GitLab dashboard showing various projects, but none of them appear to be the "Pytorch GAN" repository that I need to find. I need to search for this specific repository first before I can access its contributor statistics.

I can see there's a search box available with the description "Search or jump to…" which should allow me to search for the Pytorch GAN repository. Once I find and navigate to that repository, I'll need to access its contributor statistics to get the email addresses of the top 3 contributors ranked by commits.

Let me start by searching for the Pytorch GAN repository.<｜end▁of▁thinking｜>I need to search for the Pytorch GAN repository first since it's not visible in the current project list.

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on a search results page for "Pytorch GAN" with one project result showing - "Erik Linder-Norén / PyTorch-GAN". This appears to be the repository I need. Instead of searching again, I should click on this project link to navigate to the actual repository page where I can then access contributor statistics.

The project link has the text "Erik Linder-Norén / PyTorch-GAN" and appears to be clickable. Once I'm on the repository page, I'll need to find the contributors section to get the email addresses of the top 3 contributors by commit count.

```click('281')```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the PyTorch-GAN repository page. I need to find the contributor statistics to identify the top 3 contributors by commit count and their email addresses. 

From the accessibility tree, I can see various navigation options including "Repository", "Issues", "Merge Requests", etc. However, I don't see a direct "Contributors" link in the current view. I should look for repository statistics or activity information that might contain contributor data.

I notice there's an "Activity" link under the Project section, and also a "193 Commits" link in the repository statistics. The commits link might lead me to a page where I can see contributor information. Let me click on the commits link to access the commit history where I should be able to see contributor statistics.

```click('519')```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the commits page for the PyTorch-GAN repository (as indicated by the URL and page title). The accessibility tree shows a list of commits with author information including email addresses. However, I need to find the top 3 contributors ranked by number of commits, which would require seeing aggregated commit counts per contributor.

From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a "Contributors" link available in the repository navigation menu (element ID 267). This is likely the page that will show aggregated contributor statistics with commit counts, which is exactly what I need to answer the user's question.

Let me navigate to the Contributors page where I should be able to see the top contributors ranked by commit count along with their email addresses.

```click('267')```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the Contributors page for the PyTorch-GAN repository. The accessibility tree shows a list of contributors with their email addresses and commit counts, ranked in descending order by number of commits. 

I can see the top 3 contributors are:
1. eriklindernoren - 87 commits - email: eriklindernoren@gmail.com
2. Erik Linder-Norén - 58 commits - email: eriklindernoren@live.se  
3. pinnacle - 8 commits - email: pinnacle.chen@qq.com

The data is clearly visible and I can now provide this information to the user.

```send_msg_to_user("The top 3 contributors to the PyTorch-GAN repository ranked by number of commits are:\n1. eriklindernoren@gmail.com (87 commits)\n2. eriklindernoren@live.se (58 commits)\n3. pinnacle.chen@qq.com (8 commits)")```
