Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing projects. The goal is to review a merge request on a "404 link" (which likely refers to a specific merge request that needs review). 

First, I need to navigate to the merge requests section since I'm currently on the projects dashboard. I can see there's a "Merge requests" link in the sidebar with bid 165.

Let me click on that to go to the merge requests dashboard where I can find the specific merge request that needs review.

```click("165")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I'm already on the Merge Requests dashboard (the page title is "Merge Requests · Dashboard · GitLab"). The accessibility tree shows there are currently 0 open, merged, closed, or total merge requests assigned to me (Byte Blaze). This suggests there might not be any merge requests to review, or the filter might be too restrictive.

However, the goal mentions a specific "404 link" merge request that needs review. Since there are no merge requests showing in the current filtered view, I should first check if there are merge requests available by removing or adjusting the current filter. I can see there's an "Assignee Byte Blaze" filter applied with a close button (bid 296) that I can click to remove this filter and see all merge requests.

Let me remove the assignee filter to see if the merge request appears in the list.

```click("296")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that after removing the assignee filter, the page still shows "Sorry, your filter produced no results." This suggests there might not be any merge requests available in the current view, or I need to navigate to a different section to find the specific "404 link" merge request.

Since the goal mentions a specific merge request that needs review, I should try searching for it directly. I can see there's a search box (bid 299) labeled "Search or filter results..." where I can search for the merge request by its title or reference.

Let me search for "404" to find the specific merge request mentioned in the goal.

```click("299")```
```fill("299", "404")```
```keyboard_press("Enter")```

Looking at the current situation, I've searched for "404" but the page still shows "Sorry, your filter produced no results." This suggests that either:

1. The merge request isn't in my current view/dashboard
2. The merge request might be in a different project or group
3. The search might need different terms

Since the goal mentions a specific "404 link" merge request that I need to review, and I can't find it through the current dashboard search, I should try a different approach. Let me check if there are any merge requests available by looking at all merge requests without any filters. I notice there's an "All" filter option (bid 253) that shows all merge requests regardless of state.

Let me click on the "All" filter to see if any merge requests appear, which might include the one I'm looking for.

```click("253")```

Looking at the current situation, I've tried multiple approaches to find the merge request:

1. I'm already on the Merge Requests dashboard
2. I removed the assignee filter
3. I searched for "404" 
4. I applied the "All" filter

Despite all these attempts, the page consistently shows "Sorry, your filter produced no results" or similar empty states. This suggests that either:

- The merge request doesn't exist in my current view/scope
- I don't have access to the merge request
- The merge request might be in a different project or group that I need to navigate to first

Since I cannot locate the merge request through the current dashboard interface, I should report this as infeasible and ask the user for more specific information about where to find this merge request (such as the project name or direct URL).

```report_infeasible("I cannot find the '404 link' merge request in the current dashboard view. The search and filters return no results. Please provide the specific project name or direct URL to the merge request so I can navigate to it directly.")```
