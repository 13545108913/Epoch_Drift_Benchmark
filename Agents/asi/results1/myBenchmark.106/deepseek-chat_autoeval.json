The action history shows the agent searched for 'ghost' and clicked some elements, then searched for 'R1kk3r' and filled the search box, pressed Enter, and clicked an element. However, the final state indicates the agent is still on a search results page for \"R1kk3r\" and has not actually navigated to any user profile or performed a follow action. Additionally, there is no action for the third user 'Abishek'. Since the agent has not successfully followed any of the users and is not on a page where following has occurred, the task is incomplete and unsuccessful.", "uid": 106}]
