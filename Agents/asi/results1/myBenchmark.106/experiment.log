Looking at the current page, I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing projects. To follow users 'ghost', 'R1kk3r', and 'Abishek', I need to navigate to a search or explore page where I can find and follow these users. The current page shows project listings but no direct way to search for users.

I notice there's a search box in the navigation with bid 142 that says "Search or jump to...". This search functionality should allow me to search for users. I'll use this to search for the first user 'ghost'.

```search_project('142', 'ghost')```

I should click on the "Users 2" link to view the user search results, which will allow me to find and follow the 'ghost' user.

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the Ghost User's profile page. The accessibility tree shows the user's profile information but doesn't explicitly show a "Follow" button or similar element. However, on GitLab, the follow functionality is typically available on user profile pages. I should look for a follow button or similar element. Since I don't see it in the current accessibility tree, I might need to scroll down or look for additional UI elements that aren't captured in the current view.

Let me first try scrolling down to see if there's a follow button that's not currently visible in the viewport.

```scroll(0, 300)```

Looking at the current state, I can see I'm on the Ghost User's profile page after scrolling down. The accessibility tree shows various profile sections but still no explicit "Follow" button. On GitLab, the follow functionality is typically represented by a button with text like "Follow" or an icon. Since I don't see it in the current view, I should try scrolling further down or look for alternative UI patterns. Let me scroll more to ensure I've seen the entire profile page.

```scroll(0, 500)```

Looking at the current state, I can see I'm on the Ghost User's profile page after scrolling down. The accessibility tree shows various profile sections including "Overview", "Activity", "Groups", etc., but I still don't see a "Follow" button. On GitLab, the follow functionality might be located in a different part of the UI or might require checking if I'm already following this user. Since I've scrolled significantly and haven't found a follow button, it's possible that either:

1. The follow button is not visible in the current accessibility tree representation
2. I'm already following this user
3. The follow functionality is located elsewhere

Let me try to navigate to a different section of the profile or look for alternative ways to find the follow action. I'll try clicking on the "Activity" tab to see if the follow button appears in a different context.

```click('246')```

Looking at the current state, I'm still on the Ghost User's profile page (Activity tab). The accessibility tree shows various navigation tabs and activity content, but I still don't see a "Follow" button. 

Since I've tried scrolling and navigating to different tabs without finding a follow button, it's possible that either:
1. The follow functionality is not available for this user (e.g., they might be a bot or system account)
2. The follow button is represented differently in the UI than expected
3. I need to look for it in a different location

Let me try searching for the other users to see if the follow functionality is available for them. I'll use the search box to find 'R1kk3r'.

```search_project('142', 'R1kk3r')```

Looking at the error message, I see that the search box with bid '142' is actually a dropdown div element, not a standard input field. This explains why the fill action failed - I can't directly type into a div element. 

Looking back at the accessibility tree, I can see there's actually a searchbox element with bid '143' that's marked as focused. This appears to be the actual search input field. Let me use this instead to search for 'R1kk3r'.

```fill('143', 'R1kk3r')```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I successfully filled the search box with 'R1kk3r' (the searchbox shows "R1kk3r" as the current value). The accessibility tree shows search results are displayed in a dropdown list below the search box. I can see various search result options including '"R" in all GitLab', 'User settings', 'Dashboard', etc., but I don't see any user-specific results for 'R1kk3r' yet.

Since the search results are showing but don't include the user I'm looking for, I should press Enter to execute the search and see the full search results page, which should include user matches.

```keyboard_press('Enter')```
