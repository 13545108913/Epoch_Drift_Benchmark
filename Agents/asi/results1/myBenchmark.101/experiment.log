Looking at the current page, I can see a list of GitLab projects but I don't see star counts displayed for each repository. To star the top three most starred repos, I first need to find a way to sort or identify which repos have the most stars. 

The current view shows projects sorted by "Last updated" but doesn't show star counts. I should navigate to a view that shows star counts or allows sorting by stars. Let me try clicking on "Explore projects" which might show a more comprehensive list with sorting options.

```click("237")```

Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see that there's a "Most stars" link available in the navigation (bid 275). This should take me to a view where projects are sorted by star count, which is exactly what I need to identify the top three most starred repos. Let me click on that link to get the properly sorted list.

```click("275")```

Looking at the current page, I can see that I'm now on the "Most stars" view (bid 275 was clicked), which should show projects sorted by star count in descending order. The accessibility tree shows several projects with their star counts displayed - I can see star counts like "55", "52", "51", etc. for the first few projects.

The top three most starred repos appear to be:
1. "Umano: News Read To You / AndroidSlidingUpPanel" with 55 stars
2. "Meta / create-react-app" with 52 stars  
3. "Karl Kroening / ffmpeg-python" with 51 stars

Now I need to star these three repositories. Looking at the accessibility tree, I don't see explicit "Star" buttons, but in GitLab, the star/unstar functionality is typically available on the project page itself. I should navigate to each project page and star them individually. Let me start with the top project.

```click("306")```
