Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. To star the top eight most starred repos, I first need to find which repos have the most stars. I can see some star counts in the project listings (like "21" for "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" and "6" for "Byte Blaze / empathy-prompts"), but I need to see all projects sorted by star count to identify the top eight.

The current view appears to be sorted by "Last updated" (based on the button with that text). I should change the sorting to show projects by star count to easily identify the most starred ones.

```click("244")```

Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see there's a dropdown menu for sorting projects that's currently expanded (expanded=True). The option "Most stars" is available at position [259] with the link to sort by stars in descending order. This will sort the projects by star count from highest to lowest, making it easy to identify the top eight most starred repos.

```click("259")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the projects are now sorted by stars (descending) based on the URL parameter `sort=stars_desc`. I can identify the top eight most starred repos by their star counts:

1. "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" - 21 stars
2. "Primer / design" - 21 stars  
3. "Byte Blaze / empathy-prompts" - 6 stars
4. "Byte Blaze / millennials-to-snake-people" - 6 stars
5. "Byte Blaze / ericwbailey.website" - 2 stars
6. "Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club" - 2 stars
7. "Byte Blaze / a11y-syntax-highlighting" - 1 star
8. "Byte Blaze / remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline" - 0 stars

Now I need to star each of these top eight repos. I'll start with the first one. Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see there's a star icon/image element associated with each project listing that I can click to star/unstar the repo.
