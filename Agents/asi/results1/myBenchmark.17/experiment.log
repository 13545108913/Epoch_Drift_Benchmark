Looking at the current page, I can see a list of repositories with their star counts displayed. The goal is to find repositories where I made contributions that have zero stars.

From the accessibility tree, I can see several repositories with star counts:
- "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" has 21 stars
- "Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club" has 2 stars  
- "Primer / design" has 21 stars
- "Byte Blaze / remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline" has 0 stars
- "Byte Blaze / ericwbailey.website" has 2 stars
- "Byte Blaze / empathy-prompts" has 6 stars
- "Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space" has 0 stars
- "Byte Blaze / accessible-html-content-patterns" has 0 stars
- "Byte Blaze / a11y-syntax-highlighting" has 1 star
- "Byte Blaze / millennials-to-snake-people" has 6 stars
- "Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme" has 0 stars
- "Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt" has 0 stars
- "Byte Blaze / timeit" has 0 stars
- "Byte Blaze / dotfiles" has 0 stars

I need to identify which of these repositories I contributed to (not just own). Since I can see the role labels like "Maintainer" and "Developer", I can assume I have some level of involvement in all the "Byte Blaze" repositories. The repositories with 0 stars where I'm listed as "Maintainer" or "Developer" are:
- Byte Blaze / remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline
- Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space  
- Byte Blaze / accessible-html-content-patterns
- Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme
- Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt
- Byte Blaze / timeit
- Byte Blaze / dotfiles

I'll now send this information to the user.

```send_msg_to_user("Based on the repositories displayed, the repositories where you made contributions and have zero stars are:\n- Byte Blaze / remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline\n- Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space\n- Byte Blaze / accessible-html-content-patterns\n- Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme\n- Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt\n- Byte Blaze / timeit\n- Byte Blaze / dotfiles")```
