Looking at the current page, I can see this is a GitLab dashboard showing various projects. The goal is to add users as maintainers to a "GitHub timeline item management extension" project. Based on the project list, I can see there's a project called "remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline" which matches the description of a GitHub timeline item management extension.

I need to navigate to that specific project first, then find the settings to add maintainers. Let me click on that project link.

```click('567')```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the Members page for the project "remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline". The page shows an "Invite member" section where I can add new members. I need to:

1. Search for the first user 'abisubramanya27' in the "Select members to invite" search box
2. Set their role to "Maintainer"
3. Add them to the project

I can see the search box has bid 452, and the role dropdown has bid 460. Let me start by searching for the first user.

```fill('452', 'abisubramanya27')```

The role dropdown is a combobox that needs to be expanded first to select the "Maintainer" option.

Looking at the error message, it appears the "Maintainer" option (bid 464) is not currently visible in the viewport, which is causing the timeout when trying to click it. The role dropdown was expanded, but the option might be outside the visible area.

I need to scroll the page to make the "Maintainer" option visible, then click it. Since the dropdown is already expanded, I'll scroll down a bit to bring the Maintainer option into view.

```scroll(0, 200)```

Looking at the error, it seems the "Maintainer" option (bid 464) is still not visible even after scrolling. The dropdown might have closed or the element might not be properly accessible. Let me try a different approach - I'll reopen the role dropdown first to ensure it's expanded, then select the Maintainer option.

The role dropdown has bid 460. Let me click it again to expand the options, then immediately select the Maintainer option.
