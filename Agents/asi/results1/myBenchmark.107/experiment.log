Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the GitLab dashboard showing projects. To follow users on GitLab, I need to navigate to a search or explore page where I can find and follow these users. The current page doesn't show any direct way to search for or follow users.

I notice there's a search box in the navigation (bid 142) that says "Search or jump to...". This search functionality should allow me to search for users. Let me use this to search for the first user 'Jakub Klinkovsk'.

```search_project('142', 'Jakub Klinkovsk')```

Looking at the current page state, I can see we're already on a search results page for "Jakub Klinkovsk". The search has been executed and shows results. In the results section, I can see there's a "Users 1" link (bid 268) which indicates there is 1 user matching this search. Since the goal is to follow users, I should click on this "Users" link to view the user search results specifically.

```click('268')```

Looking at the current page state, I can see we're already on the user search results page for "Jakub Klinkovsk". The accessibility tree shows there's one user result displayed: "Jakub Klinkovský @lahwaacz" with a link to their profile (bid 279). Since the goal is to follow users, I should click on this user profile link to navigate to their profile page where I can find the follow button.

```click('279')```

Looking at the current state, I can see we're now on Jakub Klinkovský's GitLab profile page (username "lahwaacz"). The page shows their profile information, activity, and personal projects. To follow this user, I need to find a "Follow" button on their profile page.

Scanning through the accessibility tree, I don't see any obvious "Follow" button or similar element. GitLab typically has a follow/unfollow button on user profiles, but it might not be visible in the current view or might require scrolling. Let me first try scrolling down to see if there's a follow button further down the page.

```scroll(0, 300)```

Looking at the current state, I can see we're on Jakub Klinkovský's GitLab profile page after scrolling. I still don't see a "Follow" button in the accessibility tree. GitLab's follow functionality might be located in a different part of the interface or might require being logged in with appropriate permissions. 

Since I can't find a follow button on this profile page, and we need to follow multiple users, let me try a different approach. I'll use the search functionality again to search for the next user "convexegg" and see if I can find a follow option there or if there's a pattern I'm missing.

```search_project('142', 'convexegg')```

Looking at the error message, I see that the search box element with bid "142" is actually a dropdown div, not a standard input field. This explains why the fill action failed - it's not a directly editable element. 

Let me examine the accessibility tree more carefully. I can see there's a searchbox with bid 143 that's marked as focused. This appears to be the actual search input field within the dropdown. Let me try using this element instead for the search.

```fill('143', 'convexegg')```

Looking at the current state, the search for "convexegg" is still showing "Loading..." in the results. This suggests the search is taking longer than expected to complete. Since we've already waited several seconds, let me try pressing Enter to execute the search if it hasn't been triggered yet, or try a different approach by navigating directly to the search results page.

Let me press Enter to ensure the search is executed:
