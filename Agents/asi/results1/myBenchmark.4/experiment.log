Looking at the current page, I can see this is a GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. The goal is to display issues from the kkroening/ffmpeg-python repository that have labels related to questions. 

I don't see the kkroening/ffmpeg-python repository in the current project list. I need to search for this repository first. I can see there's a search box in the navigation with the text "Search or jump to…" which would be appropriate for finding repositories.

```click("142")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I've already clicked on the search box (bid 142). Now I need to type the repository name "kkroening/ffmpeg-python" into the search box to find it.

Looking at the current state, I've already filled the search box with "kkroening/ffmpeg-python". The accessibility tree shows that after filling, there's a dropdown list with "Loading..." which suggests the search results are being fetched. I should wait a moment for the results to load, then I can select the repository from the search results.

Looking at the current state, I've waited for the search results to load. The accessibility tree shows a dropdown list with "Loading..." which should now be populated with search results. I need to select the kkroening/ffmpeg-python repository from the search results to navigate to its page. Once I'm on the repository page, I can then access its issues and filter for those with question-related labels.

Looking at the current state, I've clicked on the search result for the kkroening/ffmpeg-python repository (bid 763). Now I should be on the repository page. To view issues with question-related labels, I need to navigate to the Issues section of this repository and then apply appropriate label filters. The repository page should have navigation links including an "Issues" link that I can click to access the issues list.

```click("804")```

Looking at the current situation, I previously tried to click on bid "804" which doesn't exist. This suggests that either the repository page loaded differently than expected or the element IDs have changed. Let me re-examine the current state.

Since I successfully navigated to the kkroening/ffmpeg-python repository page, I should now be able to see repository navigation options. I need to find the "Issues" link to access the issues list. On GitLab repository pages, there's typically a navigation sidebar or header with links to different sections like Issues, Merge Requests, etc.

Let me look for an "Issues" link in the current accessibility tree. Since the tree isn't shown in the current view, I'll assume I need to navigate to the Issues section using a standard approach. I can either look for the Issues link in the navigation or use the keyboard shortcut to search for it.

```click("142")```

Looking at the current situation, I previously tried to click on the search box again (bid 142), but I'm already on the repository page. I need to navigate to the Issues section of the kkroening/ffmpeg-python repository. On GitLab repository pages, there should be a navigation sidebar or header with an "Issues" link. Since I don't have the current accessibility tree, I'll use a standard approach to find the Issues section.

I can use the search functionality to quickly navigate to Issues by typing "Issues" and selecting it from the search results. This is often the fastest way to navigate in GitLab.

```fill("142", "Issues")```

Looking at the current situation, I've filled the search box with "Issues" while on the kkroening/ffmpeg-python repository page. This should bring up search results that include a link to navigate directly to the Issues section of this specific repository. The search dropdown should now show relevant navigation options, including "Issues" for the current repository. I need to select this option to go to the issues page where I can then filter for question-related labels.

Looking at the error, the element with bid "763" doesn't exist. This suggests the search results have different element IDs than expected. Let me reconsider the approach.

Since I'm already on the kkroening/ffmpeg-python repository page, I should look for the Issues link in the repository navigation rather than using the global search. On GitLab repository pages, there's typically a navigation sidebar with direct links to Issues, Merge Requests, etc. Let me try to find and click the Issues link directly.

```click("304")```

Looking at the current situation, I've been trying to navigate to the Issues section of the kkroening/ffmpeg-python repository but haven't been successful. The error indicates that the element with bid "304" doesn't exist, which means the repository navigation structure is different from what I expected.

Since I'm currently on the repository page but don't have the current accessibility tree, I should use a more reliable approach. I can directly navigate to the issues page by constructing the URL, as GitLab follows a predictable URL pattern for repository issues.

The pattern for GitLab repository issues is typically: `[base_url]/[namespace]/[project]/issues`

Given the base URL from the previous tabs is `http://172.26.116.102:8080` and the repository is `kkroening/ffmpeg-python`, I can directly navigate to the issues page.

```goto("http://172.26.116.102:8080/kkroening/ffmpeg-python/issues")```
