Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing projects. To assign an issue about flash alert in the primer design guide repo to myself, I first need to find and navigate to that specific repository. I don't see "primer design guide" in the currently visible project list, so I'll need to search for it.

I can see there's a search box available in the navigation with bid 142 that says "Search or jump to…" - this should allow me to search for the primer design guide repository.

```search_project('142', 'primer design guide')```
