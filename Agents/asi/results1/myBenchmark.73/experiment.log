Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the GitLab dashboard. To set my status as "Out of Office", I need to navigate to my user profile settings where the status can be configured. I can see my user profile link in the top navigation - it's the link with my avatar image and username "byteblaze" (bid 186).

I'll click on my profile link to access the user menu and then navigate to the settings where I can set my status.

```click("186")```

Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see that after clicking on my profile link (bid 186), the user menu has expanded. I can see there's a "Settings" link (bid 202) in the dropdown menu, which is where I need to go to configure my user status. The menu also shows my current status as "Resting due to leg injury" and has an "Edit status" button, but I should navigate to the full settings page to ensure I can properly set the "Out of Office" status.

```click("202")```

Looking at the current page, I can see we're already on the User Settings page (Profile section). I can see the "Current status" section with a textbox showing the current status "Resting due to leg injury" (bid 400). To set my status as "Out of Office", I need to update this textbox with the new status message.

```fill("400", "Out of Office")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the status textbox (bid 400) already contains "Out of Office" as its value, which means the status has been successfully set. Now I need to save these changes by clicking the "Update profile settings" button at the bottom of the form to make the status change permanent.

```click("512")```
