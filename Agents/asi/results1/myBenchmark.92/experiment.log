Looking at the goal, I need to invite Abishek to the dotfiles repository as a guest. I can see the "Byte Blaze / dotfiles" project listed in the current page. To invite someone as a guest, I need to navigate to the project's settings/members page.

First, I should click on the dotfiles project link to go to its main page, then navigate to the members/invitation section.

I can see the dotfiles project link with bid '901' in the accessibility tree. Let me click on that to open the dotfiles project page.<｜end▁of▁thinking｜>```click("901")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the Members page (URL: http://172.26.116.102:8080/byteblaze/dotfiles/-/project_members) based on the accessibility tree. I can see the "Invite member" tab and the search box for selecting members to invite.

To invite Abishek as a guest, I need to:
1. Search for "Abishek" in the member search box
2. Select the "Guest" role (which appears to be already selected by default)
3. Click the "Add to project" button

I can see the search box has bid '490' and is labeled "Search for members to update or invite". Let me start by searching for Abishek.

```fill("490", "Abishek")```

Now I need to select Abishek from the search results. I can see the option element with bid '607' that represents "Abishek S @abisubramanya27". I should click on this option to select Abishek for invitation.

```click("607")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the action to click "Add to project" was executed. The accessibility tree now shows a success message "Users were successfully added." at the top, and I can see Abishek S (@abisubramanya27) listed in the "Existing members and groups" section with the "Guest" role and "Given access just now" timestamp.

This confirms that Abishek has been successfully invited to the dotfiles repository as a guest. The goal has been accomplished - Abishek can now check the dotfile configurations as requested.

I should send a confirmation message to the user to let them know the task has been completed successfully.

```send_msg_to_user("Successfully invited Abishek S (@abisubramanya27) to the dotfiles repository as a guest. He now has access to check your dotfile configurations.")```
