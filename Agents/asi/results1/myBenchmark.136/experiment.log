Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard projects page. To create a new public project called "AutoAGI" and add primer as members, I need to first navigate to the new project creation page. I can see there's a "New project" link on the page with bid 223.

Let me click on that link to start creating the new project.

```click("223")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the "New Project" page (Tab 0), which is exactly where I need to be to create the project. The page shows a form with fields for project name, project slug, description, visibility level, and other options.

To create a public project called "AutoAGI":
1. I need to fill in the project name field (bid 259) with "AutoAGI"
2. Set the visibility level to public (bid 296)
3. Click the "Create project" button (bid 310)

After creating the project, I'll need to navigate to the project settings to add primer as members, but first let me create the project.

```fill("259", "AutoAGI")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the project name field (bid 259) already has "AutoAGI" filled in, which matches my goal. Now I need to set the project to public visibility. I can see there are three radio buttons for visibility levels:
- Private (bid 282) - currently checked
- Internal (bid 289) - not checked  
- Public (bid 296) - not checked

Since I need to create a public project, I should click the Public radio button (bid 296).

```click("296")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the project name is already set to "AutoAGI" and the public visibility radio button (bid 296) is now checked (focused and checked='true'). The form appears to be ready for project creation. 

The next step is to click the "Create project" button (bid 310) to actually create the project. After the project is created, I'll need to navigate to the project settings to add primer as members.

Looking at the current page, I can see the project "AutoAGI" was successfully created (as indicated by the message "Project 'AutoAGI' was successfully created."). Now I need to add primer as members to this project. 

To add members, I need to navigate to the project settings and then to the members management section. I can see there's a "Settings" link in the sidebar with bid 362. Clicking this should take me to the project settings where I can manage members.

I can see in the sidebar navigation that there's a "Members" link with bid 375 under the Settings section. This is exactly what I need to click to get to the member management page where I can add new members.

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the "Members" page for the AutoAGI project. The page shows an "Invite member" section where I can search for users and add them to the project. 

To add "primer" as a member:
1. I need to use the search box (bid 452) to search for "primer"
2. Select the appropriate role from the dropdown (bid 460)
3. Click the "Add to project" button (bid 474)

Let me start by searching for "primer" in the member search box.

```fill("452", "primer")```

The search results are showing an option for "Primer @primer" (bid 569) in the dropdown list, which means the user was found.

Now I need to select this user from the dropdown. Since the search box is focused and the results are available, I should press Enter to select the user. After selecting the user, I'll need to choose an appropriate role and then click the "Add to project" button.

```keyboard_press("Enter")```

Since the goal doesn't specify a particular role, I'll proceed with the default "Guest" role and then add the user to the project.
