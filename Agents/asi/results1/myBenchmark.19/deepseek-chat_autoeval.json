The agent performed a search for \"theme editor\" across open, closed, and all assigned issues, and found no matching issues. The agent's response accurately states that no such issue was found among the user's assigned issues. Since this is an information-seeking task, the agent's response must either contain the requested information or explicitly state that it is not available. The agent has done the latter, so the task is successful.", "uid": 19}]
