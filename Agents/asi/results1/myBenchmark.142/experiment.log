Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard projects page. To accomplish the goal of creating a private project "agi_index" with HTML template and adding Vinta Chen as a member, I need to first create a new project. I can see there's a "New project" link on the page.

The accessibility tree shows a link with the text "New project" and URL "http://172.26.116.102:8080/projects/new". I should click this link to start the project creation process.

```click("223")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the "New Project" page (Tab 0), which means my previous action successfully navigated to the project creation form. Now I need to create a private project called "agi_index" with an HTML template.

The accessibility tree shows:
- A textbox for "Project name" (bid 259) that's currently focused
- A "Create from template" tab (bid 242) that I need to select to use an HTML template
- Radio buttons for visibility level, with "Private" (bid 282) already checked

First, I should switch to the "Create from template" tab to access the HTML template option.

```click("242")```

Looking at the current state, I can see I'm on the "Create from template" tab (which is focused and selected). I can see various template options including "Pages/Plain HTML" which matches the HTML template requirement. I need to select this template and then proceed with creating the project.

I can see the "Pages/Plain HTML" template has a radio button with bid 441 that I need to select.

```click("441")```

Looking at the error message, I can see that the click on the radio button (bid 441) failed because there's an overlapping element (the span with bid 442) intercepting the click. The error suggests that the actual "Use template" text span is covering the radio button and preventing the click.

I should try clicking on the label text instead, which should still select the radio button. Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see the label contains the radio button and the text "Use template". The label has bid 440.

```click("440")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the "Pages/Plain HTML" template has been successfully selected (the radio button is now checked). Now I need to proceed with creating the project by filling in the project name as "agi_index" and ensuring it's private (which it already is based on the accessibility tree showing the private radio button is checked).

The project name textbox has bid 543 and is currently focused. I should fill it with "agi_index".

```fill("543", "agi_index")```

The project creation form appears to be properly configured with:
- Template: Pages/Plain HTML ✓
- Project name: agi_index ✓  
- Visibility: Private ✓

Now I need to click the "Create project" button to complete the project creation. The accessibility tree shows a button with bid 586 labeled "Create project".

4. There's a role dropdown set to "Guest" (bid 499)
5. The "Add to project" button is currently disabled (bid 513)

To add Vinta Chen as a member, I need to:
1. Search for "Vinta Chen" in the member search box
2. Select the appropriate role (likely "Developer" or "Maintainer" based on typical project permissions)
3. Click the "Add to project" button

I'll start by searching for Vinta Chen in the member search box.
