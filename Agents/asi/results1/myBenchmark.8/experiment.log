I need to find out how many commits Eric made to the a11yproject on 3/2. Currently, I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. I can see "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" listed, which is likely the project in question. To find commit information, I should navigate to that project's page first.

Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see a link for "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" with bid 286. Clicking this should take me to the project page where I can access commit history.

```click("286")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the a11yproject.com project page. I need to find commit information specifically for Eric on 3/2. The page shows some commit activity in the file listing, but I need to access the full commit history to filter by author and date.

I can see there's a "Repository" section in the navigation with a link to "History" (bid 653) which should take me to the commit history. This is likely where I can find the complete commit list and potentially filter by author or date.

```click("653")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the commit history page for the "add-color-utility-classes" branch. The page shows commits grouped by date, with dates like "25 Aug, 2020", "22 Aug, 2020", etc. However, I need to find commits specifically from March 2nd (3/2), but all the visible dates are from August 2020.

Since I don't see any March dates in the current view, I need to either:
1. Scroll down to see more commits from different dates
2. Use the search/filter functionality to find commits from March 2nd

I can see there's a search box labeled "Filter by commit message" (bid 496), but this filters by commit message, not by date or author. For finding commits by Eric on a specific date, I should look for a way to filter commits by author and date, or continue scrolling to find March commits.

Let me first try scrolling down to see if there are more commits from different dates, including March.

```scroll(0, 500)```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the commit history page for the "add-color-utility-classes" branch. The visible commits are all from August 2020 (25 Aug, 22 Aug, 21 Aug, etc.), but I need to find commits from March 2nd (3/2). 

Since I don't see any March dates in the current view, I should continue scrolling down to load more commits and potentially find March dates. The page appears to have a lot of commit history, so I need to scroll further to access commits from earlier months.

Looking at the current situation, I can see that I'm still on the commit history page for the "add-color-utility-classes" branch, and all visible commits are from August 2020. I need to find commits from March 2nd (3/2), which would be from a different year since these are all from 2020.

The current view shows commits going back to August 2020, but I need to find March commits. Since March comes before August in the calendar year, I should actually be looking for commits from March 2020 or earlier, which would appear further down the page (as GitLab typically shows commits in reverse chronological order).

I should continue scrolling down to load older commits and hopefully reach March 2020.

I've been scrolling down repeatedly but only seeing August 2020 commits. This suggests that either:
1. The branch "add-color-utility-classes" was created in August 2020 and doesn't contain commits from March 2020
2. I need to switch to a different branch (like main/master) to see older commits
3. The project might not have any commits from March 2nd

Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see there's a button labeled "add-color-utility-classes" (bid 473) which is likely a branch selector. I should click this to see other available branches and switch to the main branch where I might find older commits.

```click("473")```
