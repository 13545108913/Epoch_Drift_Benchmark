[{"idx": 108, "gt": 0.0, "rm": false, "thoughts": "The user's intent is to invite both Jakub Klinkovsk\u00fd and Beno\u00eet Blanchon as collaborators to the gimmiethat.space repo. The action history shows that the agent successfully added Jakub Klinkovsk\u00fd (actions 4-8), but for Beno\u00eet Blanchon, the agent only clicked the search box and filled in the name (actions 9-10), without completing the invitation process (e.g., selecting a role and confirming the invitation). The final state description confirms that Jakub Klinkovsk\u00fd was added, but it only mentions the intention to add Beno\u00eet Blanchon, not that he was actually invited. Since the task requires both to be invited and the second invitation was not completed, this is a failure.", "uid": 108}]
