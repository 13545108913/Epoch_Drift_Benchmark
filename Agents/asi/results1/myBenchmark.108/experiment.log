Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the Members page for the gimmiethat.space repository (as indicated by the URL and the "Project members" heading). The page shows an "Invite member" section with a search box for selecting members, a role permission dropdown, and an "Add to project" button.

To invite Jakub Klinkovský and Benoît Blanchon as collaborators, I need to:
1. Search for each user in the "Select members to invite" search box
2. Select the appropriate role for them
3. Click "Add to project"

I'll start by searching for Jakub Klinkovský in the member search box, which has bid 490.
