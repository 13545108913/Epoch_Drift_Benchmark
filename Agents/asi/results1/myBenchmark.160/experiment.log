Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. I need to find the specific project "a11yproject.com" to create a merge request from the "redesign" branch to the "markdown-figure-block" branch and assign myself as reviewer.

First, I need to locate the a11yproject.com project in the list. I can see there's a search box with the text "Filter by name..." which would help me find the specific project quickly.

```click("241")```

Looking at the project list, I don't see "a11yproject.com" in the visible projects. I need to search for it using the search functionality. I already clicked on the search box, so now I should type the project name to filter the results.

```fill("241", "a11yproject.com")```
