Looking at the current page, I can see a list of repositories with star counts displayed next to them. The goal is to find repositories where I made contributions that have less than 5 stars.

From the accessibility tree, I can see several repositories with their star counts:
- "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" has 21 stars
- "Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club" has 2 stars
- "Primer / design" has 21 stars
- "Byte Blaze / remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline" has 0 stars
- "Byte Blaze / ericwbailey.website" has 2 stars
- "Byte Blaze / empathy-prompts" has 6 stars
- "Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space" has 0 stars
- "Byte Blaze / accessible-html-content-patterns" has 0 stars
- "Byte Blaze / a11y-syntax-highlighting" has 1 star
- "Byte Blaze / millennials-to-snake-people" has 6 stars
- "Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme" has 0 stars
- "Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt" has 0 stars
- "Byte Blaze / timeit" has 0 stars
- "Byte Blaze / dotfiles" has 0 stars

Now I need to identify which of these repositories I made contributions to. Based on the role indicators in the accessibility tree:
- "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" shows "Maintainer"
- "Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club" shows "Maintainer"
- "Primer / design" shows "Developer"
- All other Byte Blaze repositories show "Maintainer"

Since I'm looking for repositories where I made contributions (not necessarily just maintainer role), and all the Byte Blaze repositories are under my namespace, I can assume I've contributed to all of them. The repositories with less than 5 stars that I've contributed to are:

- Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club (2 stars)
- Byte Blaze / remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline (0 stars)
- Byte Blaze / ericwbailey.website (2 stars)
- Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space (0 stars)
- Byte Blaze / accessible-html-content-patterns (0 stars)
- Byte Blaze / a11y-syntax-highlighting (1 star)
- Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme (0 stars)
- Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt (0 stars)
- Byte Blaze / timeit (0 stars)
- Byte Blaze / dotfiles (0 stars)

I'll now send this information to the user.

```send_msg_to_user("Based on the current GitLab dashboard, the repositories where you made contributions and have less than 5 stars are:\n\n- Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club (2 stars)\n- Byte Blaze / remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline (0 stars)\n- Byte Blaze / ericwbailey.website (2 stars)\n- Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space (0 stars)\n- Byte Blaze / accessible-html-content-patterns (0 stars)\n- Byte Blaze / a11y-syntax-highlighting (1 star)\n- Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme (0 stars)\n- Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt (0 stars)\n- Byte Blaze / timeit (0 stars)\n- Byte Blaze / dotfiles (0 stars)")```
