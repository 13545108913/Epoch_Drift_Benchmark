Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the GitLab dashboard in the "Projects" section. To create a new group with members, I need to navigate to the Groups section first. I can see there's a "Groups" button in the navigation menu with bid 76.

The goal is to create a new group called "webagent" with members pandey2000, sayakpaul, and sayakpaul (note: sayakpaul appears twice in the goal, which might be a duplication).

First, I need to navigate to the Groups section where I can create a new group.

```click("76")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that after clicking the "Groups" button (bid 76), the groups dropdown has expanded. I can now see options for "Your groups" and "Explore groups". To create a new group, I need to navigate to the groups management page where I can find the option to create a new group. The "Your groups" link (bid 83) seems like the appropriate next step to access group management features.

```click("83")```

Looking at the current page state, I can see we're already on the Groups dashboard page (URL: http://172.26.116.102:8080/dashboard/groups). I can see a "New group" link with bid 222 at the top of the page. Since we need to create a new group called "webagent" with specific members, the next logical step is to click on the "New group" link to start the group creation process.

```click("222")```

Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the "New Group" page (URL: http://172.26.116.102:8080/groups/new) with the form ready to be filled out. The goal is to create a group named "webagent" with specific members. 

First, I need to fill in the required "Group name" field with "webagent". I can see there's a textbox with bid 235 that is focused and required for the group name.

```fill("235", "webagent")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the group name field (bid 235) has already been filled with "webagent" from my previous action. The form appears to be ready for submission, but I notice the goal also requires adding members (pandey2000, sayakpaul, sayakpaul) to the group. However, the current "New Group" form doesn't show any member addition fields - this functionality typically appears after the group is created.

The most logical next step is to create the group first, then navigate to the group's member management page to add the specified users. I can see the "Create group" button with bid 287 at the bottom of the form.

```click("287")```

I can see in the navigation sidebar there's a "Members" link (bid 291) under the group settings. This is where I need to go to manage group members and add the specified users.

Looking at the current page, I can see we're now on the "Members" page for the "webagent" group (URL: http://172.26.116.102:8080/groups/webagent/-/group_members). The goal requires adding members pandey2000, sayakpaul, and sayakpaul to this group.

I can see the member addition form with:
- A search textbox (bid 360) for finding users
- A role dropdown (bid 367) for setting permissions
- An "Add to group" button (bid 382)

The "Add to group" button is currently disabled, which means I need to first search for and select users to add. I'll start by adding the first user "pandey2000".

```fill("360", "pandey2000")```
