Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. I need to find the "time tracking tool project repo" mentioned in the goal. Based on the project list, I can see a project called "timeit" with the description "Rails implementation of time tracking tool timeit" - this appears to be the time tracking tool project I need to access.

To invite collaborators, I first need to navigate to this specific project page. I'll click on the "timeit" project link to access its project page where I can then manage collaborators.

```click('867')```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the "timeit" project page (the time tracking tool project). The goal is to invite collaborators, which typically requires accessing the project settings. In GitLab, project member management is usually found in the Settings section.

I can see a "Settings" link in the navigation sidebar with bid 395. I should click on this to access the project settings where I can manage collaborators.

```click('395')```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the General Settings page for the "timeit" project. The goal is to invite collaborators, which in GitLab is typically done through the "Members" section within project settings. I can see in the accessibility tree that there's a "Members" link in the settings sidebar with bid 407. This is where I should navigate to manage project members and invite collaborators.

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the "Members" page for the "timeit" project. The accessibility tree shows the "Invite member" tab is available but not currently selected (selected=False). I need to invite specific users as collaborators, so I should first ensure I'm on the "Invite member" tab.

The "Invite member" tab has bid 474, and I can see it's not currently selected. I should click on this tab to access the member invitation interface where I can search for and add the specified users.

```click('474')```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the "Invite member" tab of the project members page. The accessibility tree shows a search box with bid 490 where I can "Search for members to update or invite." To invite the specified collaborators (Jakub K, Alex Dills, Alex Hutnik, and Benoît Blanchon), I need to search for each user and add them with the appropriate role.

The "Add to project" button is currently disabled (bid 512), which means I need to first search for and select members before I can add them. I'll start by searching for the first user, Jakub K.

```fill('490', 'Jakub K')```

Looking at the current state, I can see that after searching for "Jakub K", the accessibility tree shows three search results are available (Jakub Jirutka, Jakub Klinkovský, and Jakub T. Jankiewicz), but none of them match exactly "Jakub K". The search results appear in a list with options that can be selected. Since "Jakub K" doesn't exactly match any of the displayed results, I should try searching for the other users mentioned in the goal to see if they can be found.

Let me search for "Alex Dills" next to see if that user exists in the system.

```fill('490', 'Alex Dills')```

The status message indicates "One result is available, press enter to select it."

Since Alex Dills appears in the search results, I need to select this user from the dropdown to add them as a collaborator. I should press Enter to select the highlighted result.

Looking at the current state, I can see that after pressing Enter to select "Alex Dills", the user has been added to the selection list (shown in the accessibility tree as "Alex Dills" with a remove link). The "Add to project" button (bid 512) is now enabled since I have selected at least one member to invite.

Now I need to continue adding the remaining collaborators. The goal specifies inviting Jakub K, Alex Dills, Alex Hutnik, and Benoît Blanchon. I've successfully added Alex Dills, so I should now search for and add the next user, Alex Hutnik.

```fill('490', 'Alex Hutnik')```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I've successfully added both Alex Dills and Alex Hutnik as collaborators. The accessibility tree shows both users are now selected in the invitation list. I need to continue adding the remaining users specified in the goal: Jakub K and Benoît Blanchon.

Since my previous attempt to find "Jakub K" didn't yield an exact match, I should try searching for "Benoît Blanchon" next to see if that user exists in the system. If I can find Benoît Blanchon, I can add them, and then try alternative search terms for Jakub K if needed.
