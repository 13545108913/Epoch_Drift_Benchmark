The final state explicitly mentions that Jakub K was not found and Beno\u00eet Blanchon was not yet added, and the agent's response is \"None,\" meaning no confirmation or update was provided. Since the goal was to invite all four, and only two were successfully added, the task is incomplete and thus a failure.", "uid": 111}]
