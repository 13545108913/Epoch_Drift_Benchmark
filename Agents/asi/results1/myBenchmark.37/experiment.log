Looking at the current page, I can see the "Primer / design" project listed in the projects dashboard. To find out who has made the most commits to this project, I need to navigate to the project's detailed page where I can access repository statistics and contributor information. The project link is visible in the accessibility tree with the text "Primer / design".

I'll click on the "Primer / design" project link to navigate to its project page where I can find commit statistics and contributor information.

```click("354")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the commits page for the "a11y/context-menu-accessibility-docs" branch of the Primer/design project. The page shows individual commits grouped by date, but I need to find overall contributor statistics for the entire project, not just this specific branch.

In the sidebar navigation, I can see there's a "Contributors" link (bid 271) under the Repository section. This is exactly what I need - it should show statistics about all contributors to the project, including their commit counts.

I'll click on the "Contributors" link to navigate to the contributor statistics page.

```click("271")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the Contributors page for the Primer/design project. The page shows a list of contributors with their commit counts. From the accessibility tree, I can see that Shawn Allen has "95 commits" listed, which appears to be the highest number among all contributors shown. The list is sorted with the highest contributors at the top, confirming that Shawn Allen has made the most contributions to this project in terms of number of commits.

I'll now send this information to the user.

```send_msg_to_user("Shawn Allen has made the most contributions to the primer/design project with 95 commits.")```
