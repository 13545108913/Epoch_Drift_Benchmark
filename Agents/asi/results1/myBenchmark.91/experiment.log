Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the Members page for the solarized-prism-theme project (as indicated by the URL and the "Project members" heading). The page shows an "Invite member" section where I can search for users to invite. I need to:

1. Search for "yjlou" in the "Select members to invite" search box (bid 490)
2. Select the appropriate role permission (currently set to "Guest")
3. Click the "Add to project" button

The "Add to project" button is currently disabled (bid 512), which means I need to first search for and select yjlou to enable it. I'll start by filling the search box with "yjlou".

```fill("490", "yjlou")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that after filling "yjlou" in the search box (bid 490), the accessibility tree shows that there's a search result available for "yjlou @yjlou" (bid 646) with a status message indicating "One result is available, press enter to select it." The "Add to project" button is still disabled, which means I need to actually select the user from the search results to enable the button.

I should press Enter to select the suggested user "yjlou" from the search results.

```keyboard_press("Enter")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that after pressing Enter to select "yjlou" from the search results, the user should now be selected. The "Add to project" button (bid 512) should now be enabled since we have a valid user selected. I can verify this from the accessibility tree which shows the user "yjlou @yjlou" is now available in the status area.

Now I need to click the "Add to project" button to complete the invitation process.

```click("512")```
