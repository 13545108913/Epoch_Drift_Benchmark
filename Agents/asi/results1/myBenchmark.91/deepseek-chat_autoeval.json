[{"idx": 91, "gt": 1.0, "rm": true, "thoughts": "The user's intent is to invite \"yjlou\" as a collaborator to \"solarized-prism-theme,\" which is a content modification task. The action history shows the agent performed a series of steps: clicking elements (likely to navigate to the correct page or section), filling a search field with \"yjlou,\" pressing Enter to select the user, and finally clicking the \"Add to project\" button (bid 512). The final state description confirms that \"yjlou\" was successfully selected and the \"Add to project\" button was enabled and clicked. Since the task is content modification, I only need to examine the action history and final state, which indicate the invitation process was completed as intended.", "uid": 91}]
