Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the GitLab dashboard with a list of existing projects. To create a new repository called "webagent", I need to find and click the "New project" link that's visible in the accessibility tree.

The accessibility tree shows there's a link with the text "New project" and URL "http://172.26.116.102:8080/projects/new" at position [223]. This is exactly what I need to click to start creating a new repository.

```click("223")```

Looking at the current page state, I can see we're already on the "New Project" page in GitLab (Tab 0). The accessibility tree shows we're on the project creation form with various input fields. 

Since the goal is to create a new empty repository named "webagent", I need to:
1. Fill in the "Project name" field with "webagent"
2. The "Project slug" field will likely auto-populate based on the project name
3. Ensure "Initialize repository with a README" is unchecked (since we want an empty repository)
4. Click the "Create project" button

The "Project name" textbox is focused and has bid 259, so I'll start by filling that field.

```fill("259", "webagent")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the "Project name" field (bid 259) already has the value "webagent" filled in, as shown in the accessibility tree. The "Project slug" field (bid 270) also shows "webagent" as the value. 

Since we want an empty repository, I need to ensure the "Initialize repository with a README" checkbox is unchecked. The accessibility tree shows it's currently unchecked (checked='false'), which is correct for an empty repository.

Now I can proceed to click the "Create project" button (bid 310) to complete the repository creation process.

```click("310")```
