Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing projects. To assign an issue regarding flash alerts to myself and primer, I need to first navigate to the issues section where I can find and manage issues.

I can see there's an "Issues" link in the navigation sidebar with the text "Issues" and a count of "10" next to it. This is likely the link to my assigned issues dashboard. Let me click on that to navigate to the issues page where I can search for the specific issue about flash alerts.

```navigate_to_issues('161')```

Looking at the current page state, I can see that I'm already on the Issues dashboard page (Tab 0 shows "Issues · Dashboard · GitLab" as the title). The page shows a list of issues assigned to me, with various issue titles like "Better sharing solution", "Better initial load experience", etc.

Since I'm already on the issues page, I don't need to navigate to issues again. Now I need to find the specific issue about "flash alerts" in the current list. I can see several issues displayed, but none of the visible titles mention "flash alerts". I should search for this specific issue using the search functionality.

I can see there's a search box in the navigation with ID '144' that appears to be for searching across GitLab. Let me use that to search for the flash alerts issue.

```search_issues('144', 'flash alerts')```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I already performed a search for "flash alerts" in the search box (ID '144'), but the accessibility tree doesn't show any search results yet - it just shows "Loading..." in the search results list. The search might still be processing or the issue might not be found in my currently assigned issues.

Since I'm already on my assigned issues dashboard and the search didn't immediately show results, I should wait a moment for the search to complete and then check if the flash alerts issue appears in the results. If it doesn't appear, I may need to broaden my search or navigate to a different issues view.

Let me wait for the search results to load properly.

Looking at the current state, I can see that I searched for "flash alerts" in the search box (ID '144') and waited for results, but the accessibility tree still shows "Loading..." in the search results list. This suggests the search is still processing or no results were found in my assigned issues.

Since I'm currently viewing only my assigned issues (the URL shows `assignee_username=byteblaze`), the flash alerts issue might not be assigned to me yet, which is why it's not appearing in the search results. To find and assign this issue, I need to search across all issues, not just my assigned ones.

I should modify my search approach by first clearing the current assignee filter. I can see there's an assignee filter button with the text "Assignee Byte Blaze ×" which indicates I'm currently filtering by my assigned issues. Let me clear this filter to search across all issues.

```click('301')```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I tried to clear the assignee filter by clicking on what I thought was the filter element (ID '301'), but the accessibility tree doesn't show an element with that ID. The current page shows I'm still on my assigned issues dashboard with the URL parameter `assignee_username=byteblaze`.

I need to find a way to search across all issues, not just my assigned ones. I can see there's a search box at the top (ID '144') that says "Search or jump to…" with the value "flash alerts". This appears to be a global search that searches across all of GitLab, not just issues. Let me use this to search more broadly for the flash alerts issue.

Since I've already entered "flash alerts" in the search box, I just need to execute the search by pressing Enter.

```keyboard_press('Enter')```

Looking at the current situation, I've been trying to find the "flash alerts" issue but have been limited by searching only within my assigned issues. The global search I just executed should show results across all projects and issues, not just those assigned to me.

The search has been initiated with "flash alerts" and I pressed Enter to execute it. Now I should wait for the search results to load properly so I can see if the flash alerts issue appears in the results. Once the results load, I'll be able to identify the specific issue and then assign it to myself and primer.

Looking at the current situation, I've executed a global search for "flash alerts" across all GitLab projects and issues. The search should now be processing and I've waited for the results to load. The next step is to examine the search results to see if the flash alerts issue appears. If it does, I can click on it to open the issue details page, where I can then assign it to myself and primer.

Since I don't see any error messages and the search should have completed, let me check what's currently displayed on the page to see if the search results are now visible with the flash alerts issue.

Looking at the current situation, I've executed a global search for "flash alerts" and waited for results to load. The search should now be complete, but I don't see any specific issue titles related to flash alerts in the current accessibility tree. The tree still shows the same list of my assigned issues, which suggests either:

1. The search results are not being displayed in the current view
2. No issues matching "flash alerts" were found
3. The search results are displayed elsewhere on the page

Since I'm on a GitLab dashboard and performed a global search, the results might be displayed in a different section or might require me to navigate to a dedicated search results page. Let me check if there are any visible search result elements or if I need to interact with the search interface differently.

I notice there's a search box (ID '144') that still shows "flash alerts" as the value. Let me try clicking on it again to see if it reveals search suggestions or results dropdown.

Since I clicked on the search box (ID '144') which already has "flash alerts" entered, this might open a dropdown with search suggestions or results. Let me wait a moment for any dropdown or suggestions to appear, then I can interact with them if they contain the flash alerts issue.

Looking at the current situation, I've been trying to find the "flash alerts" issue through the global search but haven't been successful in locating it in the current view. The accessibility tree still shows my assigned issues, which suggests the search results might not be displaying properly or the issue doesn't exist in the current search scope.

Since I'm on the GitLab dashboard and the global search hasn't yielded visible results, I should try a different approach. I notice there's a dedicated search/filter box specifically for issues with ID '303' that says "Search or filter results..." This is likely a more targeted search within the issues context, rather than the global search I've been using. Let me try searching for "flash alerts" in this issues-specific search box.
