Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard with a list of existing projects. To create a new private HTML repository called "web_agent_index" using a template, I need to click on the "New project" link that's visible in the accessibility tree.

The "New project" link has bid 223 according to the accessibility tree, which will take me to the project creation page where I can select templates and configure the repository settings.

```click("223")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the "New Project" page in GitLab. The accessibility tree shows I have three tabs available: "Blank project", "Create from template", and "Import project". Since the goal is to create a repository using a template to speed up development, I should click on the "Create from template" tab.

The "Create from template" tab has bid 242 according to the accessibility tree.

```click("242")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the "Create from template" tab is already focused and selected (selected=True in the accessibility tree). Now I need to find the appropriate HTML template for creating the "web_agent_index" repository. 

From the available templates, I can see several HTML-related options:
- "Pages/Plain HTML" - which is described as "Everything you need to create a GitLab Pages site using plain HTML"
- "Pages/Hugo" - Hugo static site generator
- "Pages/Jekyll" - Jekyll static site generator
- "Pages/GitBook" - GitBook documentation
- "Pages/Hexo" - Hexo static site generator

Since the goal is to create an HTML repository and the "Pages/Plain HTML" template specifically mentions it's for plain HTML sites, this seems like the most appropriate template to use. The radio button for this template has bid 441.

```click("441")```

Looking at the error message, I can see that the click on the radio button (bid 441) failed because the element is being intercepted by other elements. The error shows that a span element (bid 442) and a help dropdown (bid 174) are intercepting pointer events, preventing the click from reaching the radio button.

Since the radio button itself is difficult to click directly due to these overlapping elements, I should try clicking on the associated label text instead. In the accessibility tree, I can see there's a LabelText element with bid 440 that contains the radio button and the text "Use template". Clicking on the label should select the radio button without the interception issues.

```click("440")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the "Create from template" tab is active and I need to select the "Pages/Plain HTML" template. The previous attempt to click the radio button directly failed due to element interception, so I should try a different approach.

From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a "Change template" button (bid 537) that might allow me to browse and select from available templates. This could be a more reliable way to select the HTML template rather than trying to click the radio button directly.

```click("537")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the "Create from template" tab is active and I've tried various approaches to select the "Pages/Plain HTML" template. The previous attempts to click the radio button directly or its label failed due to element interception, and clicking the "Change template" button didn't resolve the issue.

Let me re-examine the accessibility tree. I notice that for the "Pages/Plain HTML" template, there's a link element with bid 439 labeled "Preview" that might be clickable without interception issues. Since this is part of the same template section, clicking it might help navigate to the template selection or at least interact with the template area.

```click("439")```
