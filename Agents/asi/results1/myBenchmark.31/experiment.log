Looking at the current page, I can see we're on a GitLab dashboard showing various projects. The user wants to clone the most starred Covid location tracker with SSH. However, I don't see any projects related to Covid location trackers in the current view. I need to search for such a project first.

I can see there's a search box available with the bid '142' that can be used to search for projects. Let me search for "covid location tracker" to find relevant projects.

```search_project('142', 'covid location tracker')```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the search has already been performed for "covid location tracker" but the results show "We couldn't find any results matching covid location tracker". This means there are no projects matching this search term in this GitLab instance. Since the goal is to clone the most starred Covid location tracker with SSH, but no such projects exist in this GitLab instance, I should inform the user that no results were found.

```send_msg_to_user("No Covid location tracker projects were found in this GitLab instance. The search returned no results.")```
