Looking at the current page, I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing projects. To set my homepage URL in my GitLab profile, I need to navigate to my user profile settings. I can see there's a link to my profile in the top navigation - it's the link with my username "byteblaze" (bid 186). I should click on that to access my profile page, then navigate to the settings where I can update my homepage URL.

```click("186")```

Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see that after clicking on my profile link (bid 186), a dropdown menu appeared with options including "Profile" and "Settings". To update my homepage URL, I need to access the settings page where profile information can be edited. The "Settings" link (bid 202) is exactly what I need to click to get to the profile settings page where I can modify my homepage URL.

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the User Settings page with a form containing various profile fields. I need to find the "Website url" field to set my homepage URL. In the accessibility tree, I can see there's a textbox labeled "Website url" with bid 481. This is exactly where I need to enter the homepage URL "https://egg.tart.com". I'll fill this field with the URL.

```fill("481", "https://egg.tart.com")```

Looking at the current page state, I can see that the "Website url" field (bid 481) already contains the value "https://egg.tart.com" - this means my previous fill action was successful. Now I need to save these changes by clicking the "Update profile settings" button, which has bid 512 in the accessibility tree. This will apply the new homepage URL to my GitLab profile.

```click("512")```
