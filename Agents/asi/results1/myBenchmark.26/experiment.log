Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the GitLab dashboard showing projects. To get an RSS feed token, I need to navigate to user settings where RSS tokens are typically managed. In GitLab, this is usually found in the user profile dropdown menu.

I can see there's a user profile link at the top right with the username "byteblaze" (element [186]). Clicking this should open a dropdown menu where I can access settings.

```click("186")```

Looking at the current state, I just clicked on the user profile dropdown (element [186]). Now I should see the expanded dropdown menu which contains options like "Profile" and "Settings". To access RSS feed tokens, I need to go to the Settings page where such tokens are typically managed in GitLab.

From the accessibility tree, I can see that after clicking [186], the dropdown is now expanded (expanded=True) and contains a "Settings" link at element [199]. This is where I should navigate to find RSS feed token options.

```click("199")```

Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the User Settings page, specifically the Profile section. To get an RSS feed token, I need to navigate to the Access Tokens section where RSS tokens are typically managed in GitLab. I can see in the sidebar navigation that there's an "Access Tokens" link at element [255] which should lead to the correct page.

```click("255")```

Looking at the current page, I can see we're already on the "Personal Access Tokens" page in GitLab. The accessibility tree shows a "Feed token" section at the bottom with element [415] that contains the actual RSS feed token value "WGSbhmKxvxTLvfeB52B1". The user's goal is to get their RSS feed token, which is already visible on this page. I should simply send this token value to the user.

```send_msg_to_user("Your RSS feed token is: WGSbhmKxvxTLvfeB52B1")```
