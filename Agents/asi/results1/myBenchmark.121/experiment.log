Looking at the current page, I can see we're already on the Issues page for the a11yproject.com repository. I can see a "New issue" link with bid 491. This is exactly what I need to click to start creating a new issue with the title "401 bad gateway", assign it to Roshanjossey, and set the due date to the end of 2030.

Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the "New Issue" page for the a11yproject.com repository. The form is already loaded with the necessary fields:

1. Title field (bid 478) - I need to fill this with "401 bad gateway"
2. Assignee field (bid 571) - I need to assign to Roshanjossey
3. Due date field (bid 687) - I need to set to the end of 2030

The "Submit issue" button is currently disabled (bid 693), which means I need to fill in the required fields first. Let me start by filling in the title field.

```fill("478", "401 bad gateway")```

2. The assignee field shows "Unassigned" (bid 571) - I need to assign this to Roshanjossey
3. The due date field (bid 687) is empty - I need to set it to the end of 2030

The next step is to assign the issue to Roshanjossey. I need to click on the assignee field to open the assignment dropdown and then search for and select Roshanjossey.

Looking at the error, the year dropdown option for 2030 (bid 792) is not currently visible in the viewport, which is causing the timeout when trying to click it. The date picker likely needs to be scrolled to make the 2030 option visible. Since the year dropdown is already open and showing options from 2015-2035, I should scroll within the dropdown to bring the 2030 option into view.

I can use the scroll action to scroll down in the date picker area to make the 2030 option visible.

```scroll(0, 200)```
