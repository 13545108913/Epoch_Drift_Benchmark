Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on a GitLab dashboard showing various projects, but none of them appear to be from Facebook. To fork all repos from Facebook, I first need to find Facebook's projects. The search functionality in the navigation bar would be the best way to locate Facebook's repositories.

I can see there's a search box with the description "Search or jump to…" in the accessibility tree at position [142]. I'll use this to search for Facebook projects.

```search_project('142', 'facebook')```

Looking at the current page state, I can see that I'm already on a search results page for "facebook" (the search box shows "facebook" as the current value). The search results show various categories like Projects, Issues, Merge requests, etc. The Projects category shows "0" results, which means no Facebook projects were found in this GitLab instance.

Since there are no Facebook projects available to fork in this GitLab instance, I should inform the user about this situation rather than attempting to perform actions that won't work.

```send_msg_to_user("I searched for Facebook projects in this GitLab instance, but found 0 results. There are no Facebook repositories available to fork in this environment.")```
