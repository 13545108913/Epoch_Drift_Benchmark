Looking at the goal, I need to invite Jakub Klinkovský to the dotfiles repository as a guest. I can see from the accessibility tree that there's a "Byte Blaze / dotfiles" project listed in the projects dashboard. This appears to be the dotfiles repository mentioned in the goal.

To invite someone as a guest, I first need to navigate to the specific repository page, then access the project settings or members section where I can add collaborators.

The "Byte Blaze / dotfiles" project has a link with bid '901' that I can click to navigate to the repository page.

```click("901")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the "Byte Blaze / dotfiles" repository page. The accessibility tree shows various navigation options including a "Settings" link with bid '395' in the sidebar. To invite someone as a guest, I need to access the project settings where member management is typically located.

The "Settings" link should lead me to a page where I can manage project members and invite collaborators.

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the "Members · Byte Blaze / dotfiles" page, which is exactly where I need to be to invite Jakub Klinkovský as a guest. The accessibility tree shows the "Invite member" section with a search box for selecting members (bid '490'), a role selection dropdown (bid '498') currently set to "Guest", and an "Add to project" button (bid '512').

Since I need to invite Jakub Klinkovský, I should first search for him in the member selection field. The search box has bid '490' and is labeled "Select members to invite".

```fill("490", "Jakub Klinkovský")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I've already filled "Jakub Klinkovský" into the search box (bid '490'), and the accessibility tree shows that there's a dropdown list with an option for "Jakub Klinkovský @lahwaacz" (bid '723'). This means the search has found the user and is displaying them as a selectable option.

To complete the invitation process, I need to select Jakub Klinkovský from the dropdown results, then click the "Add to project" button. The role is already set to "Guest" which matches the goal requirements.

Looking at the current state, I can see from the accessibility tree that Jakub Klinkovský (@lahwaacz) is already listed as a guest member in the "Existing members and groups" section (bid '645'). The status message "Users were successfully added" at the top of the page and the "Given access just now" timestamp for Jakub Klinkovský indicate that the invitation was already successfully completed in my previous actions.

Since Jakub Klinkovský is already added as a guest to the dotfiles repository, the goal has been accomplished. I should inform the user that the task is complete.

```send_msg_to_user("Jakub Klinkovský has been successfully invited to the dotfiles repository as a guest. He is now listed as a project member with Guest permissions.")```
