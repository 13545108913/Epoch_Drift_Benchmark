Looking at the current page, I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. I need to find the "2019-nCov" repository to check its contributors. Since this repository isn't visible in the current project list, I should use the search functionality to find it.

I can see there's a search box with the description "Search or jump to…" in the accessibility tree. I'll use this to search for the "2019-nCov" repository.

```search_project('142', '2019-nCov')```

Looking at the current page, I can see that I'm already on a search results page for "2019-nCov" and there's one project result shown: "yjlou / 2019-nCov". This appears to be the repository I need to access to find contributor information. The project link is visible in the accessibility tree with the heading "yjlou / 2019-nCov" and a URL pointing to the project page.

I should click on this project link to navigate to the repository page where I can then access contributor statistics.

```click('281')```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the 2019-nCov repository page. I need to find the top 3 contributors ranked by number of commits. On GitLab, contributor statistics are typically found in the repository section. I can see there's a "Repository" link in the navigation menu with bid '250'. I should click on this to access the repository view where I can then find contributor information.

```click('250')```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the repository page for 2019-nCov (the URL shows "/tree/master"). In the repository navigation menu, I can see there's a "Contributors" link with bid '268' that should show the contributor statistics I need. This is exactly what I need to access to find the top contributors ranked by number of commits.

```click('268')```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the Contributors page for the 2019-nCov repository. The accessibility tree shows a list of contributors with their names and commit counts. I can see the top contributors are:

1. Louis Lo - 286 commits
2. Stimim Chen - 50 commits  
3. Owen Chu - 2 commits

The goal is to list the last names of the top 3 contributors ranked by number of commits. From the information displayed, I can extract:
- Lo (from Louis Lo)
- Chen (from Stimim Chen) 
- Chu (from Owen Chu)

I now have the information needed to answer the user's question.

```send_msg_to_user("The last names of the top 3 contributors to the 2019-nCov repo, ranked by number of commits, are: Lo, Chen, Chu")```
