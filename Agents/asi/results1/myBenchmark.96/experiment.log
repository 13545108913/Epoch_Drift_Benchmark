Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see the "Byte Blaze / dotfiles" project listed at the bottom with bid 901. Since Vinta wants to check my dotfile configurations, I need to navigate to that specific repository first, then I can invite him as a guest from the project settings.

```click("901")```

Looking at the current page, I can see we're already on the "Members · Byte Blaze / dotfiles · GitLab" page (as shown in the active tab title). The accessibility tree shows the "Invite member" tab panel is active, with a search box for selecting members (bid 490), a role selection dropdown set to "Guest" (bid 498), and an "Add to project" button (bid 512) that is currently disabled.

Since I need to invite Vinta as a guest, I should first search for Vinta in the member search box, then ensure the role is set to Guest, and finally click the "Add to project" button once it becomes enabled.

```fill("490", "Vinta")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I've already filled "Vinta" into the member search box (bid 490). The accessibility tree shows that there's a search result available for "Vinta Chen @vinta" (bid 763), and the system even indicates "One result is available, press enter to select it." I need to select Vinta from the search results to proceed with the invitation.

Looking at the current state, I can see from the accessibility tree that Vinta Chen (@vinta) has already been added as a guest to the project. The status message "Users were successfully added." appears at the top, and Vinta is listed in the "Existing members and groups" section with "Guest" role and "Given access just now." This indicates that my previous action to invite Vinta was successful.

Since the goal was to invite Vinta as a guest to check the dotfile configurations, and he has already been successfully added with the Guest role, the task is complete. I should inform the user that Vinta has been invited.

```send_msg_to_user("Vinta has been successfully invited to the dotfiles repository as a guest. He can now check your dotfile configurations.")```
