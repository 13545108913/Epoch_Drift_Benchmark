Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the GitLab dashboard with a list of existing projects. To accomplish the goal of creating a new public project "web_arena" and adding members, I need to first navigate to the project creation page. I can see there's a "New project" link available on the page.

The accessibility tree shows a link with the text "New project" and URL "http://172.26.116.102:8080/projects/new" at position [223]. This is exactly what I need to click to start creating a new project.

```click("223")```

Looking at the current page state, I can see we're already on the "New Project" page (Tab 0), which is exactly where we need to be to create the "web_arena" project. The accessibility tree shows the project creation form is loaded with all the necessary fields:

- Project name textbox (bid 259)
- Project slug textbox (bid 270) 
- Project description textbox (bid 276)
- Visibility level radio buttons (bids 282, 289, 296)
- Create project button (bid 310)

Since the goal is to create a public project called "web_arena", I need to:
1. Fill in the project name
2. Ensure the project slug is set (it appears to be required)
3. Select the "Public" visibility level
4. Click the Create project button

The project name field is already focused, so I'll start by filling it with "web_arena".

```fill("259", "web_arena")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the project name field (bid 259) already has the value "web_arena" filled in, as shown in the accessibility tree. The next step is to set the project visibility to "Public" as required by the goal. I can see there are three radio buttons for visibility levels:

- Private (bid 282) - currently checked
- Internal (bid 289) - not checked  
- Public (bid 296) - not checked

I need to click the Public radio button to make this a public project.

```click("296")```

Looking at the current page state, I can see the project "web_arena" was successfully created (as indicated by the message "Project 'web_arena' was successfully created."). The goal now requires adding Abishek and Vinta as members to this project.

To add members, I need to navigate to the project settings and then to the members management section. I can see in the accessibility tree there's a "Settings" link (bid 361) in the sidebar. This is where I should navigate to access member management.
