Looking at the current page, I can see we're on a GitLab instance with various projects listed. The user wants to clone the "best GAN python implementation" using SSH. Since this is a GitLab instance, I need to first search for GAN-related projects to find the best one.

I can see there's a search box available (bid 142) that I can use to search for projects containing "GAN" or related terms. Let me search for GAN projects first.

```search_project('142', 'GAN')```

Looking at the current page, I can see that the search for "GAN" has already been performed and there are results showing. The top result appears to be "Erik Linder-Norén / PyTorch-GAN" which is described as "PyTorch implementations of Generative Adversarial Networks." This looks like a strong candidate for the best GAN Python implementation.

Since this project appears relevant and has good metrics (45 stars, 100 issues), I should click on this project to access its repository page where I can find the SSH clone URL.

```click("281")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I'm now on the PyTorch-GAN project page. This appears to be exactly what the user is looking for - a comprehensive collection of PyTorch GAN implementations with 45 stars and extensive documentation. 

To show the SSH clone command, I need to access the clone options. I can see there's a "Clone" button/link (bid 493) in the interface. Clicking this should reveal the SSH clone URL that the user needs.

```click("493")```

Looking at the current page, I can see that the "Clone" button has been clicked and the clone options are now expanded. I can see the SSH clone URL displayed in a textbox with the value "git@localhost:eriklindernoren/PyTorch-GAN.git". 

The user specifically asked to show the command to clone this repository using SSH. The complete command would be `git clone git@localhost:eriklindernoren/PyTorch-GAN.git`. I should send this information to the user.

```send_msg_to_user("To clone the PyTorch-GAN repository using SSH, use the following command:\n\ngit clone git@localhost:eriklindernoren/PyTorch-GAN.git")```
