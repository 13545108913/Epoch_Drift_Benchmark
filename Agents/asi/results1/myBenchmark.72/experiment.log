Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the GitLab dashboard. To set a GitLab status, I need to navigate to the user profile/settings area where status can be updated. I can see there's a user profile link in the top navigation with the username "byteblaze" - this is likely where I can access profile settings to set the status.

Let me click on the user profile link to access the settings where I can set the status.

```click("186")```

Looking at the current page, I can see that after clicking the user profile link, the dropdown menu is now expanded (as indicated by "expanded=True" in the accessibility tree). In this dropdown, I can see there's a "Settings" link and an "Edit status" button. Since I need to set the GitLab status to "Resting due to leg injury", I should click the "Edit status" button to access the status editing interface.

```click("198")```

Looking at the current page state, I can see that the "Set a status" modal dialog is already open and focused. The modal shows the current status is set to "Playing Badminton" in the textbox. To change the status to "Resting due to leg injury", I need to:

1. Clear the existing text in the status textbox
2. Enter the new status text
3. Click the "Set status" button

The textbox has bid "798" and is currently focused, so I can directly fill it with the new status text.

```fill("798", "Resting due to leg injury")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the "Set a status" modal is open and the textbox (bid "798") already contains the text "Resting due to leg injury" as I filled it in the previous action. The status text is now correctly set to the desired value. The next step is to save this status by clicking the "Set status" button, which has bid "804" according to the accessibility tree.

```click("804")```
