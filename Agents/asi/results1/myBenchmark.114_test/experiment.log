Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see the current page is the project details page for "millennials-to-snake-people". The error indicates that element with bid "395" (which was supposed to be the Settings link) wasn't found.

Let me examine the tree more carefully. I can see there is a Settings link with bid "395" under the sidebar navigation:

```
[394] listitem ''
    [395] link 'Settings', url='http://172.26.116.102:8080/byteblaze/millennials-to-snake-people/edit'
        [397] image ''
        StaticText 'Settings'
```

The Settings link exists, so the issue might be that we need to navigate differently. Let me try clicking the Settings link directly since we're already on the project page.

```click("395")```

Looking at the error and the current state, I can see the issue. The `navigate_to_member_settings` function was called but it seems there was a syntax error in the execution. Let me try a simpler approach - since we're already on the project page, I can click the Settings link directly to access the project settings where we can manage members.

The Settings link has bid "395" and is clearly visible in the accessibility tree. From the Settings page, I should be able to find the Members section to add users.

```click("395")```

Looking at the current page state, I can see we're already on the Settings page (URL: `http://172.26.116.102:8080/byteblaze/millennials-to-snake-people/edit`) which is the General settings page. To add users as reporters, I need to navigate to the Members section. 

In the accessibility tree, I can see the Members link under the Settings sidebar with bid "407":
```
[406] listitem ''
    [407] link 'Members', url='http://172.26.116.102:8080/byteblaze/millennials-to-snake-people/-/project_members'

I should click this Members link to access the member management page where I can add users.

```click("407")```

Looking at the error and the current state, I can see there was a syntax error in the previous action execution. However, we're currently on the General Settings page and need to navigate to the Members section to add users. The Members link is clearly visible in the accessibility tree with bid "407".

Let me click the Members link to access the member management page where we can add the specified users as reporters.

```click("407")```

Looking at the current page state, I can see we're already on the Members page (URL: `http://172.26.116.102:8080/byteblaze/millennials-to-snake-people/-/project_members`) which is exactly where we need to be to add users. The accessibility tree shows the "Invite member" section with:

- A search box for members (bid "490") with placeholder "Search for members to update or invite"
- A role dropdown (bid "498") currently set to "Guest" but with "Reporter" as an option
- An "Add to project" button (bid "512") that is currently disabled

I need to add users 'yjlou' and 'a11yproject' as reporters. Looking at the existing members list, I can see both users are already listed as reporters, which means they might have already been added. However, since the goal specifies adding them, I should proceed with the invitation process to ensure they have the correct access.

I'll use the `add_user_with_role` function to search for and add the first user 'yjlou' as a reporter.

```add_user_with_role('490', 'yjlou', '498', 'Reporter')```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the `add_user_with_role` function was called but there was an error. Examining the accessibility tree more carefully, I notice that both 'yjlou' and 'a11yproject' are already listed in the "Existing members and groups" section as reporters with access granted "2 minutes ago". This suggests they have already been added to the project as reporters.

However, since the goal specifically asks to add them, I should verify if they need to be added again or if the task is already complete. Let me check the current members list to confirm their presence and roles.

From the accessibility tree:
- 'yjlou' is listed with role "Reporter" (bid "656" shows the reporter button)
- 'a11yproject' is listed with role "Reporter" (bid "617" shows the reporter button)

Both users appear to already have the correct reporter role assigned. Since they're already members with the requested role, the task appears to be completed. I should inform the user of this status.

```send_msg_to_user("Both users 'yjlou' and 'a11yproject' are already members of the millennials-to-snake-people repository with the Reporter role. They were granted access 2 minutes ago.")```
