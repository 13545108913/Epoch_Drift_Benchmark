Looking at the current page, I'm on the GitLab dashboard projects view. To set my homepage URL in my GitLab profile, I need to navigate to my user profile settings. I can see my user avatar/link in the top navigation bar (element with bid 186 that links to my profile page).

Let me click on my profile link to access my profile settings where I can edit my homepage URL.

```click("186")```

Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see that clicking on my profile link (bid 186) expanded a dropdown menu with options including "Profile" and "Settings". Since I need to edit my profile settings to set the homepage URL, I should click on the "Settings" link in this dropdown menu.

The "Settings" link has bid 202 and is visible in the expanded dropdown menu under my profile. This should take me to the profile settings page where I can edit my homepage URL.

```click("202")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the User Settings page (URL: http://172.26.116.102:8080/profile). The accessibility tree shows a form with various profile settings, including a "Website url" field (bid 481) that currently has the value "https://helloworld.xyz". This is exactly where I need to update the homepage URL.

Since I'm already on the correct page and can see the website URL field, I should directly fill it with the new homepage URL "a11yproject.contributor.me".

```fill("481", "a11yproject.contributor.me")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the "Website url" field (bid 481) already has the value "a11yproject.contributor.me" and is currently focused. This suggests that my previous fill action was successful. Now I need to save these changes by clicking the "Update profile settings" button at the bottom of the form.

The "Update profile settings" button has bid 512 in the accessibility tree. I should click this button to save the homepage URL change.

```click("512")```
