Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the GitLab dashboard in the "Projects" section. To create a new group with members, I need to navigate to the Groups section first. I can see a "Groups" button in the navigation menu with bid 76.

The goal is to create a group called "n-lab" with members patou, egpast, westurner, and jontutcher. The first step is to navigate to the Groups section where I can create a new group.

```click("76")```

Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see that after clicking the "Groups" button (bid 76), the groups menu expanded and now shows options including "Your groups" (bid 83) and "Explore groups" (bid 85). To create a new group, I should navigate to the "Your groups" page where I can find the option to create a new group.

Looking at the current page state, I can see we're now on the "Groups · Dashboard · GitLab" page. The accessibility tree shows there's a "New group" link with bid 222 available. Since our goal is to create a new group called "n-lab" with specific members, clicking this "New group" link is the logical next step to access the group creation form.

Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the "New Group" page in GitLab. The accessibility tree shows the group creation form is fully loaded with fields for:
- Group name (bid 235, focused and required)
- Group URL (bid 245, required)
- Group description (bid 251, optional)
- Group avatar (bid 256)
- Visibility level options

Since the goal is to create a group called "n-lab", I should first fill in the group name field. The group name field (bid 235) is already focused, so I can directly fill it with "n-lab".

```fill("235", "n-lab")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the group creation form is already filled with "n-lab" in both the Group name (bid 235) and Group URL (bid 245) fields. The form appears to be ready for submission. Since the goal is to create the group first and then add members, I should click the "Create group" button (bid 287) to proceed. After the group is created, I can then navigate to add the specified members (patou, egpast, westurner, jontutcher).

From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a "Members" link (bid 291) in the group navigation sidebar. This is where I need to go to manage group members and add the specified users.

Looking at the current page, I can see we're now on the Members page for the "n-lab" group. The accessibility tree shows the member management interface is loaded with:
- A search box (bid 360) to "Search for a user"
- A role dropdown (bid 367) to select permission levels
- An "Add to group" button (bid 382, currently disabled)

To add the first member "patou", I need to:
1. Fill the search box with "patou"
2. Select an appropriate role (likely "Developer" or "Maintainer")
3. Click the "Add to group" button

Since the role dropdown defaults to "Guest" and the goal doesn't specify roles, I'll use "Developer" as a reasonable default. I'll start by searching for "patou".

```fill("360", "patou")```

To select this user from the dropdown, I should press Enter to confirm the selection.
