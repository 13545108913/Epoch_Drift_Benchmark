Looking at the current page, I can see several issues listed in the dashboard. I need to find my latest created issue that has "better" in its title. From the accessibility tree, I can see two issues with "better" in their titles:

1. "Better sharing solution" (issue #10, created 8 years ago)
2. "Better initial load experience" (issue #8, created 8 years ago)

Both were created at the same time (8 years ago), but I should check the most recent one. Since they have the same creation time, I'll click on the first one that appears in the list to check its status.

The link for "Better sharing solution" has bid '453'.

```click("453")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the "Better sharing solution" issue page (issue #10). The goal is to check if this issue is closed. From the accessibility tree, I can see the status indicator shows "Open" (visible in the navigation section with "StaticText 'Open'"). This means the issue is currently open, not closed. I should report this status to the user.

```send_msg_to_user("The issue 'Better sharing solution' (#10) is currently open, not closed.")```
