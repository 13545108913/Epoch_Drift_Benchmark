Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard with a list of projects. I need to navigate to the a11yproject/a11yproject.com project to find the merge request related to focus edge cases and post a "close because non reproducible" comment.

From the accessibility tree, I can see the a11yproject/a11yproject.com project is listed with a link. I should click on that project link to navigate to its project page first.

```click("286")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab project page for a11yproject/a11yproject.com. I need to navigate to the merge requests section to find the specific merge request related to focus edge cases. From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a "Merge Requests" link in the navigation with the text "Merge Requests 0" (indicating there are currently 0 open merge requests). I should click on this link to view the merge requests page.

```click("304")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I'm on the merge requests page for the a11yproject/a11yproject.com project. The accessibility tree shows "Merge Requests 0" which indicates there are currently no open merge requests. This means I cannot find any merge request related to focus edge cases to post a "close because non reproducible" comment on.

Since there are no merge requests listed, I should inform the user that the goal cannot be accomplished because there are no merge requests available to comment on.

```send_msg_to_user("There are currently no open merge requests in the a11yproject/a11yproject.com project. The merge requests count shows '0', so I cannot find any merge request related to focus edge cases to post a 'close because non reproducible' comment.")```
