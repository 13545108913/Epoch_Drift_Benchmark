The agent's action history shows it navigated to the merge requests page and found there were no open merge requests (count of 0). Since the target content (the merge request) does not exist, the agent cannot perform the modification. The agent correctly identified this and informed the user, which is appropriate given the circumstances. The task cannot be completed due to the absence of the required content, not due to agent failure.", "uid": 54}]
