Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard projects page. To accomplish the goal of creating a private project called "awesome_web_agents" with a blank template and adding members, I need to first navigate to the new project creation page. I can see there's a "New project" link on the page with URL 'http://172.26.116.102:8080/projects/new'. This is the logical first step to create a new project.

```click("223")```

Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see I'm already on the "New Project" page (Tab 0 is active with URL 'http://172.26.116.102:8080/projects/new'). The page shows the project creation form with various fields. I need to:

1. Fill in the project name as "awesome_web_agents"
2. Ensure the visibility is set to "Private" (which appears to be already checked)
3. Click "Create project" to create the project

Since I'm already on the correct page, I should start by filling in the project name field, which has bid '259' and is currently focused.

```fill("259", "awesome_web_agents")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that:

1. I'm already on the "New Project" page
2. The project name field (bid '259') is already filled with "awesome_web_agents" 
3. The visibility is already set to "Private" (radio button with bid '282' is checked)
4. All other fields appear to be in their default state

Since the project name is already correctly filled and the visibility is set to private, the next logical step is to create the project by clicking the "Create project" button. This will create the blank project as specified in the goal, after which I can proceed to add the members.

Looking at the current page, I can see the project "awesome_web_agents" has been successfully created (as indicated by the success message "Project 'awesome_web_agents' was successfully created."). Now I need to add Abishek and Vinta as members to this project. 

To add members, I need to navigate to the project's member management settings. I can see there's a "Settings" link in the sidebar with bid '361'. Clicking this will take me to the project settings where I can then navigate to the members section.

The accessibility tree shows I'm in the "General" settings section, but I need to navigate to the "Members" section to add users.

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the "Members" page for the awesome_web_agents project. The page shows:

1. An "Invite member" section with:
   - A search box (bid '452') for selecting members to invite
   - A role dropdown (bid '460') currently set to "Guest"
   - An "Add to project" button (bid '474') that is currently disabled

2. An "Existing members and groups" section showing only the current user (Byte Blaze)

To add Abishek and Vinta as members, I need to:
1. Search for "Abishek" in the member search box
2. Select the appropriate role (I'll use the default "Guest" role for now)
3. Click "Add to project" to add them
4. Repeat the process for "Vinta"

Let me start by searching for and adding Abishek first.

```fill("452", "Abishek")```

1. I've successfully filled "Abishek" into the member search box (bid '452')
2. The accessibility tree shows there's a search result available for "Abishek S @abisubramanya27" (bid '569')
3. The "Add to project" button (bid '474') is still disabled because I haven't actually selected the user from the search results yet

I need to select Abishek from the search results to enable the "Add to project" button. Since the search result is available and the accessibility tree indicates "One result is available, press enter to select it", I should press Enter to select Abishek from the search results.

```keyboard_press("Enter")```

2. The accessibility tree shows "Abishek S @abisubramanya27" was selected (indicated by the status message)
3. The role dropdown (bid '460') is still set to "Guest" which is acceptable
4. The "Add to project" button (bid '474') should now be enabled since a user is selected

The next step is to click the "Add to project" button to add Abishek as a member to the project. After this, I'll need to repeat the process to add Vinta.

Looking at the error message, I see that the element with bid '452' is actually a `<ul>` (unordered list) element, not a text input field. This means I was trying to fill a non-input element. 

Looking back at the accessibility tree, I can see that the actual search input field is inside this list element. The accessibility tree shows:
- [455] textbox 'Select members to invite' value='Search for members to update or invite'

The actual text input field has bid '455', not '452'. I need to use the correct bid for the text input field to search for Vinta.
