Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the GitLab dashboard. To set the homepage URL in my GitLab profile, I need to navigate to my user profile settings. I can see there's a link to my profile in the top navigation - it's the link with my username "byteblaze" (bid 186). Clicking this should take me to my profile page where I can access settings.

```click("186")```
