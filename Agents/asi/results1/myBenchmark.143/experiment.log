Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard in the Projects section. To accomplish the goal of creating a private project called "AGISite" with a JEKYLL template and adding Rohan and Vinta as members, I need to first create a new project. I can see there's a "New project" link available in the accessibility tree.

The next logical step is to click on the "New project" link to start the project creation process.

```click("223")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the "New Project" page in GitLab. The accessibility tree shows I'm on a tabbed interface where I need to select "Create from template" to use a JEKYLL template. Currently, the "Blank project" tab is selected, so I need to switch to the template tab.

The tablist has three options: "Blank project" (currently selected), "Create from template", and "Import project". I need to click on the "Create from template" tab to access template options.

```click("242")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I'm on the "Create from template" tab in GitLab's new project page. The accessibility tree shows various template options including "Pages/Jekyll" which is exactly what I need for the goal. I can see the "Pages/Jekyll" template with a radio button option to "Use template" (bid 429).

The next step is to select the Jekyll template by clicking the radio button next to "Pages/Jekyll".

```click("429")```

Looking at the error message, I can see that the click on the radio button (bid 429) failed because there's an overlapping element (bid 430 - the "Use template" text span) intercepting the pointer events. This is a common issue with radio buttons where the label text might be covering the actual radio input element.

The better approach would be to click on the label text itself (bid 428) which should trigger the radio button selection. Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see the label structure:

[428] LabelText ''
    [429] radio 'Use template', checked='false'
    StaticText 'Use template'

I should click on the label element (bid 428) instead of the radio button itself.

```click("428")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I successfully selected the "Pages/Jekyll" template by clicking on the label. Now I need to fill in the project details to create the "AGISite" project as private and then add members. 

The form shows:
- Project name field (bid 543) is currently focused with "My awesome project"
- Project slug field (bid 554) shows "my-awesome-project"
- Visibility level is set to "Private" (radio button bid 566 is checked)

I need to:
1. Change the project name to "AGISite"
2. Ensure the project remains private (which it already is)
3. Create the project
4. Then navigate to member settings to add Rohan and Vinta

First, I'll fill in the project name field with "AGISite".

```fill("543", "AGISite")```

The next step is to create the project by clicking the "Create project" button (bid 586), then I can proceed to add members Rohan and Vinta in the project settings.

Now I need to add Rohan and Vinta as members to this project. To do this, I need to navigate to the project settings and then to the members section. I can see in the accessibility tree there's a "Settings" link (bid 395) in the project navigation sidebar.

The next step is to click on the "Settings" link to access the project settings where I can manage members.

- A role dropdown (bid 499) currently set to "Guest"
- An "Add to project" button (bid 513) that is currently disabled

To add Rohan and Vinta as members, I need to:
1. Search for "Rohan" in the member search box
2. Select the appropriate role (the goal doesn't specify, so I'll use the default "Guest" role)
3. Click "Add to project"
4. Repeat for "Vinta"

First, I'll search for "Rohan" in the member search box.

The next step is to select Rohan from the search results. Since the search results are showing and there's a status message indicating "One result is available, press enter to select it", I should press Enter to select the first matching user.
