[{"idx": 103, "gt": 0.0, "rm": false, "thoughts": "The user's intent is to follow specific users on GitLab, which is a site navigation task that involves modifying the user's following list (content modification). The agent's action history shows it successfully navigated to both user profiles but could not find a follow button, leading it to report the task as infeasible. The final state confirms the agent reached the profiles but did not perform the follow action due to the absence of the button. Since the task requires actually following the users and the agent did not achieve this, the execution is unsuccessful.", "uid": 103}]
