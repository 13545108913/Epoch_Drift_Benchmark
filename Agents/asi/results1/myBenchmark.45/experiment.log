Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. I need to find the "metaseq" repository to get contributor commit information. I don't see "metaseq" in the currently visible project list, so I should use the search functionality to find it.

I can see there's a search box with the text "Search or jump to…" which has bid 142. I'll use this to search for the metaseq project.

```search_project('142', 'metaseq')```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I'm already on a search results page for "metaseq" in GitLab. The search has been executed and shows "0" results for all categories (Projects, Issues, Merge requests, Milestones, Users). The page displays a message "We couldn't find any results matching metaseq".

Since the search returned no results for the metaseq repository, I cannot proceed with finding contributor commit statistics. The repository either doesn't exist in this GitLab instance or has a different name.

```send_msg_to_user("The search for 'metaseq' returned no results in this GitLab instance. The repository may not exist here or may have a different name. I cannot retrieve contributor commit statistics without access to the repository.")```
