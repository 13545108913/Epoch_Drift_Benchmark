The agent performed a search for \"metaseq\" but found no matching results in the GitLab instance. The agent's response clearly states that the project was not found and suggests verifying the project name or access. Since the information (SSH clone command) is not available due to the project not existing in the instance, the agent appropriately informs the user of this outcome, fulfilling the requirement for an information-seeking task where the response must contain the requested information or explicitly state it is not available.", "uid": 29}]
