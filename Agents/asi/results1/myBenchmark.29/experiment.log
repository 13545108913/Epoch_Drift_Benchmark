Looking at the current page, I can see we're on a GitLab dashboard showing various projects. The user wants to see the command to clone "metaseq" with SSH. I need to first find the metaseq project in this list, then navigate to its project page where I can find the SSH clone URL.

Scanning through the project list, I don't see "metaseq" among the visible projects. I should use the search functionality to find it. There's a search box with the description "Search or jump to…" that I can use to search for the metaseq project.

```click('142')```

Looking at the current page, I can see we're on a GitLab dashboard with a search box that has the bid '142' and description "Search or jump to…". After clicking on it, I should now be able to type "metaseq" to search for the project.

```fill('142', 'metaseq')```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the search box (bid '142') already has "metaseq" as its value (as shown in the accessibility tree: `value='metaseq'`). This means my previous fill action was successful. Now I need to either press Enter to execute the search or click on the search result that appears in the dropdown.

From the accessibility tree, I can see there are search results showing below the search box, including a result for '"m" in all GitLab'. However, I don't see a specific "metaseq" project result listed in the visible dropdown. Let me press Enter to execute the search and see the full search results.

```keyboard_press('Enter')```

Looking at the current state, I can see that we're already on a search results page for "metaseq" (as indicated by the URL and the heading "We couldn't find any results matching metaseq"). The search has already been executed and returned no results for metaseq. Since there are no projects, issues, merge requests, milestones, or users matching "metaseq" (all showing 0 results), I cannot proceed to find the SSH clone command for a non-existent project. I should inform the user that the project was not found.

```send_msg_to_user("The search for 'metaseq' returned no results. There are no projects, issues, or other items matching this name in the current GitLab instance. Please verify the project name or check if you have access to it.")```
