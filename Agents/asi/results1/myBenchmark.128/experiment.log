Looking at the current page, I'm on the project details page for the "design" project under "Primer". To submit a merge request from dialog-component branch into dialog branch and assign Carol as reviewer, I need to navigate to the Merge Requests section first. I can see there's a "Merge Requests" link in the sidebar with the text "Merge Requests 144".

Let me click on that link to navigate to the merge requests page where I can create a new merge request.```click("306")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the "New Merge Request" page. I need to:

1. Select "dialog-component" as the source branch
2. Select "dialog" as the target branch  
3. Assign Carol as the reviewer

From the accessibility tree, I can see:
- There's a "Select source branch" button (bid: 462)
- There's a target branch dropdown showing "a11y/context-menu-accessibility-docs" (bid: 505)
- I need to fill these branch selections first before I can proceed to assign reviewers

Looking at the error, it seems the "dialog" branch element (bid: 562) wasn't visible when trying to click it. The target branch dropdown is expanded and there's a search box (bid: 514) that's currently focused. I should first search for the "dialog" branch to make it visible and selectable.

Let me search for "dialog" in the branch search box to filter the list and make the "dialog" branch visible, then select it.

```fill("514", "dialog")```
