Looking at the current page, I can see a list of projects but I don't see "prism-theme" in the visible project list. I need to search for this specific repository first. I can see there's a search box available in the navigation with the description "Search or jump to…" which would be perfect for finding the prism-theme repository.

The search box appears to be at bid 142 based on the accessibility tree structure. I'll use this to search for the prism-theme repository.

```search_project('142', 'prism-theme')```

Looking at the current page state, I can see that the search has already been executed for "prism-theme" and there are search results showing. I can see two projects in the results list:

1. "小子欠扁 / solarized-prism-theme" (owned by xiaozi)
2. "Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme" (owned by byteblaze)

Since the goal is to find who else has access to "my repo prism-theme", I need to click on the Byte Blaze project (which appears to be mine) to access the repository settings where I can view members and their access levels.

```click('310')```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme project page. To see who else has access to this repository, I need to navigate to the project settings where member information is typically located. I can see a "Settings" link in the sidebar navigation with bid 392. This is where I should find member access information.

```click("392")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the Settings page for the solarized-prism-theme repository. In the Settings sidebar, I can see a "Members" option at bid 404, which is exactly where I need to go to see who else has access to this repository. This should display the list of users with access and their permission levels.

```click("404")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the Members page for the solarized-prism-theme repository. The accessibility tree shows there are existing members listed in a section with the heading "Existing members and groups". I can see two members displayed:

1. Abishek S (@abisubramanya27) with Guest role
2. Byte Blaze (@byteblaze) with Maintainer role (which is me)

The goal was to show who else has access to my repo prism-theme, and I can now see that besides myself (@byteblaze), there is one other user (@abisubramanya27) who has Guest access to the repository. I should send this information to the user.

```send_msg_to_user("Besides yourself (@byteblaze), the following user has access to your prism-theme repository:\n- Abishek S (@abisubramanya27) with Guest role")```
