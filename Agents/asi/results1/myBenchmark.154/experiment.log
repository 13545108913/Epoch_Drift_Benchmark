Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the GitLab dashboard in the Projects section. To create a new group with members, I need to navigate to the Groups section first. I can see there's a "Groups" button in the navigation menu with bid 76.

The goal is to create a new group called "x-lab" and add the specified members. The first step is to navigate to the Groups section where I can create a new group.

```click("76")```

Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see that after clicking the "Groups" button (bid 76), the groups menu expanded and now shows options including "Your groups" (bid 83) and "Explore groups" (bid 85). To create a new group, I should navigate to the groups management page where I can find the option to create a new group. The "Your groups" link seems like the appropriate place to start.

Looking at the current page state, I can see we're now on the "Groups · Dashboard · GitLab" page. The accessibility tree shows there's a "New group" link with bid 222 available on this page. This is exactly what I need to create the new group "x-lab" with the specified members.

Since we're already on the groups dashboard page and can see the "New group" link, I should click on it to start the group creation process.

```click("222")```

Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the "New Group" page with the form already loaded. The accessibility tree shows all the necessary form fields are present:

- Group name textbox (bid 235, focused)
- Group URL textbox (bid 245)
- Group description textbox (bid 251)
- Visibility level options
- Create group button (bid 287)

Since the goal is to create a group called "x-lab" with specific members, I should first fill out the group name field. The group name field is already focused, so I can directly fill it with "x-lab".

```fill("235", "x-lab")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the group name field (bid 235) has already been filled with "x-lab" from my previous action. The form appears to be ready for submission since all required fields (Group name and Group URL) have values. The Group URL field (bid 245) also automatically populated with "x-lab" based on the group name.

Since the goal is to create the group first and then add members (which typically happens after group creation), I should proceed with creating the group by clicking the "Create group" button. Once the group is created, I can navigate to the group's member management section to add the specified users.

```click("287")```

Looking at the current page state, I can see the message "Group 'x-lab' was successfully created." appears in the accessibility tree, confirming that the group creation was successful. The page now shows the group overview page for "x-lab" with various navigation options including "Members" (bid 291).

Since the group has been successfully created, the next step is to add the specified members (JonasVautherin, dilipchandima, dawiss1337, bmyun, DCMJY) to this group. I need to navigate to the Members section where I can manage group members.

```click("291")```

Looking at the current page, I can see we're now on the Members page for the "x-lab" group. The accessibility tree shows the member management interface with:

- A search box for adding new members (bid 360)
- A role dropdown (bid 367) 
- An "Add to group" button (bid 382, currently disabled)
- Existing members list showing only the current user

To add the specified members (JonasVautherin, dilipchandima, dawiss1337, bmyun, DCMJY), I need to use the search functionality to find each user and add them with appropriate roles. I'll start by searching for the first user "JonasVautherin" in the search box.

```fill("360", "JonasVautherin")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that after filling "JonasVautherin" in the search box (bid 360), the accessibility tree shows that a search result has appeared: "Jonas Vautherin @JonasVautherin" (bid 448) is available in the dropdown. The status message also confirms "One result is available, press enter to select it."

Since the search result is available, I should select JonasVautherin from the dropdown to proceed with adding them to the group. I can press Enter to select the highlighted result.

```keyboard_press("Enter")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that after pressing Enter to select JonasVautherin from the search results, the user has been added to the selection area (as indicated by the status message showing "Jonas Vautherin @JonasVautherin"). Now I need to set an appropriate role for this user before adding them to the group. The role dropdown (bid 367) is currently set to "Guest" by default, but I should assign a more appropriate role like "Developer" or "Maintainer" depending on the intended permissions.

Since the goal doesn't specify roles, I'll use "Developer" as a reasonable default role for group members. I need to select this option from the dropdown before proceeding to add the user.

```select_option("367", "Developer")```
