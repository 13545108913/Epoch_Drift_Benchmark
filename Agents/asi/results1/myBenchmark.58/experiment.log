Looking at the current page, I can see this is a GitLab instance showing a list of projects. However, the goal is to fork the PyTorch GAN repo with the most stars, which would typically be found on GitHub, not GitLab. 

Since I'm currently on a GitLab instance (172.26.116.102:8080) and the goal requires accessing GitHub to find the most starred PyTorch GAN repository, I need to navigate to GitHub first. The current GitLab instance doesn't appear to contain the PyTorch GAN repository I'm looking for.

```goto("https://github.com")```
