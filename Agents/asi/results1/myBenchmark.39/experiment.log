Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on a GitLab dashboard showing various projects. I need to find the "AndroidSlidingUpPanel" project first, then navigate to its repository to check commit statistics. Since I don't see this project in the currently listed projects, I should use the search functionality to find it.

I can see there's a search box with bid 142 that says "Search or jump to..." in the navigation. This would be the appropriate place to search for the AndroidSlidingUpPanel project.

```search_project('142', 'AndroidSlidingUpPanel')```

Looking at the current page, I can see that the search has already been performed for "AndroidSlidingUpPanel" and the results are showing. The search box (bid 208) already has the value "AndroidSlidingUpPanel" filled in, and I can see one search result for the project "Umano: News Read To You / AndroidSlidingUpPanel" with a link to the project page.

Since the project I'm looking for is already found in the search results, I should click on that project link to navigate to the project repository where I can access commit statistics and contributor information.

```click("281")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the AndroidSlidingUpPanel project page. I need to find information about commit statistics and contributors. I can see there's a link to "361 Commits" in the navigation section (bid 519), which shows the total number of commits. Clicking on this should take me to the commit history where I can see detailed information about contributors and their commit counts.

```click("519")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the commits page for the AndroidSlidingUpPanel project. The page shows individual commits grouped by date, but to find who has made the most contributions in terms of number of commits, I need to access the contributors statistics page. 

In the repository navigation sidebar (starting around bid 248), I can see there's a "Contributors" link (bid 267) which should show exactly what I need - statistics about contributors and their commit counts. This is the most direct way to answer the user's question about who has made the most commits.

```click("267")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the Contributors page for the AndroidSlidingUpPanel project. The page displays a list of contributors with their commit counts clearly shown next to their names. From the accessibility tree, I can see the first contributor listed is "tokudu" with "150 commits", which is significantly higher than the next contributor "Sergii Pechenizkyi" with "12 commits". This clearly answers the user's question about who has made the most contributions in terms of number of commits.

Since I've successfully found the information, I should now send this answer to the user.

```send_msg_to_user("The contributor with the most commits to the AndroidSlidingUpPanel project is 'tokudu' (antonlopyrev@gmail.com) with 150 commits.")```
