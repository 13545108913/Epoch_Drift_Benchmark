[{"idx": 39, "gt": 0.0, "rm": true, "thoughts": "This is an information seeking task where the user wants to know who has made the most contributions in terms of number of commits to a specific project. The agent's action history shows it successfully navigated to the contributors page and identified the top contributor. The final state confirms the page displays contributors with commit counts, and \"tokudu\" has 150 commits which is significantly higher than others. The bot's response correctly identifies \"tokudu\" as the top contributor with the correct commit count, though there's a minor formatting issue with the email address (missing closing parenthesis). However, the core information is accurate and complete, so the task is successful.", "uid": 39}]
