Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on a GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. The goal is to display issues from the "umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel" repository that have BUG-related labels. 

First, I need to find this specific repository in the project list. Scanning through the accessibility tree, I can see various projects but none match "umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel". The projects shown are all from different namespaces like "a11yproject", "byteblaze", "primer", etc.

Since I don't see the target repository in the current view, I should search for it using the search functionality available in the navigation.

```click("142")```

I just clicked on the search box (bid 142) to focus it and prepare to search for the repository. Now I need to type "umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel" to find the specific repository we're looking for.

```fill("142", "umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel")```

After filling the search box with "umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel", I should wait for the search results to load. The accessibility tree earlier showed a "Loading..." message in the search dropdown, so I need to allow time for the results to appear. Once loaded, I can select the repository from the search results to navigate to its page, where I can then access the issues and filter for BUG-related labels.

```noop(2000)```

Looking at the current state, I've filled the search box with "umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel" and waited for results to load. The search box (bid 142) was already focused when I clicked it earlier, and now it should show search results. Since the accessibility tree earlier indicated a dropdown list with search results (bid 762), I should now be able to see the repository in the search results and click on it to navigate to its page. Once on the repository page, I can then access the issues section and filter for BUG-related labels.

```click("763")```

I just clicked on the search result for "umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel" (bid 763), which should navigate me to the repository page. Now I need to wait for the page to load completely, then I can access the issues section and filter for BUG-related labels.

Looking at the current state, I've successfully navigated to the "umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel" repository page. Now I need to access the issues section of this repository. On a typical GitLab repository page, there should be navigation links for different sections like "Repository", "Issues", "Merge Requests", etc. 

From the accessibility tree, I can see various navigation elements including links for "Issues" (bid 161 in the original dashboard view), but since I'm now on the repository page, I need to find the issues link specific to this repository. The repository page should have its own navigation menu with an "Issues" link that I can click to view all issues, and then I can apply filters for BUG-related labels.

Let me look for the issues navigation link on the current repository page.

```click("161")```

Looking at the current state, I realize I may have made an error. The "Issues" link I clicked (bid 161) appears to be from the original dashboard navigation, not the repository-specific navigation. Since I'm now on the "umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel" repository page, I need to find the repository's own issues navigation link.

In GitLab, repository pages typically have a horizontal navigation bar below the repository name with links like "Project", "Repository", "Issues", "Merge Requests", etc. I should look for an "Issues" link in that repository-specific navigation menu rather than using the global dashboard navigation.

Let me wait a moment for the page to fully load and then look for the repository's issues navigation link.

```noop(1000)```

Looking at the current situation, I realize I may have navigated to the repository page but haven't yet found the repository-specific issues navigation. The goal is to view issues from the "umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel" repository with BUG-related labels.

From the original accessibility tree, I can see that when I was on the dashboard, there was a search box (bid 142) and I used it to find the repository. Now that I'm presumably on the repository page, I need to locate the repository's issues section.

Since I don't have the current accessibility tree after navigating to the repository, I should first try to find the issues navigation link. In GitLab, repository pages typically have a navigation bar with "Issues" as one of the main options. Let me try to find and click on the repository's issues link.

```click("161")```

Looking at the error message, it appears the element with bid "161" is not visible on the current page. This makes sense because I'm now on the repository page, not the dashboard where that element was originally located. 

I need to find the repository-specific navigation menu. In GitLab, repository pages typically have a horizontal navigation bar with options like "Project", "Repository", "Issues", "Merge Requests", etc. Since I don't have the current accessibility tree after navigating to the repository, I should use a different approach.

Let me try using the keyboard to navigate to the issues section. In GitLab, pressing "g" then "i" (for "go to issues") is a common keyboard shortcut to navigate to the issues page of a repository.

```keyboard_press("g")```
```noop(100)```
```keyboard_press("i")```

Looking at the current situation, I realize I've been trying to navigate to the issues section of the "umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel" repository but haven't been successful. The keyboard shortcut approach I just tried may not have worked as expected, and I don't have visibility into the current page structure after navigating to the repository.

Since I successfully searched for and navigated to the "umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel" repository earlier, but now I'm struggling to find the repository-specific issues navigation, let me try a more direct approach. I should construct the URL directly to the issues page of this specific repository, which would be more reliable than trying to navigate through the UI.

The pattern for GitLab repository issues URLs is typically: `http://172.26.116.102:8080/umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel/issues`

```goto("http://172.26.116.102:8080/umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel/issues")```
