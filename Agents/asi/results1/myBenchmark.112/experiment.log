2. Select "Developer" from the role permission dropdown
3. Click the "Add to project" button

Looking at the error message, it appears the "Developer" option (bid 501) in the dropdown is not currently visible, which caused the timeout when trying to click it. The dropdown is open but the element might be outside the visible viewport.

I should scroll the page to make the Developer option visible, then click it. Since the dropdown is already open, I'll scroll down slightly to bring the Developer option into view.

```scroll(0, 100)```

Looking at the error message, it seems the "Developer" option (bid 501) is not visible even after scrolling. The dropdown might have closed or the element might not be properly accessible. Let me try a different approach - I'll use the select_option function which is designed specifically for selecting options in dropdowns, rather than trying to click the individual option element.

The select_option function can select options by their label text, which should be more reliable. I'll use it to select "Developer" from the role permission dropdown (bid 498).

```select_option("498", "Developer")```
