Looking at the current page, I can see the GitLab dashboard with a list of projects. I need to find the "byteblaze/empathy-prompts" project to access its merge requests. I can see this project listed in the projects list with the heading "Byte Blaze / empathy-prompts" and a link to the project.

I should click on this project link to navigate to the project page where I can then find the merge requests related to fixing broken links.

The project link has bid "453" according to the accessibility tree.

```click("453")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the "Byte Blaze / empathy-prompts" project page. The accessibility tree shows this is the project details page with various navigation options. I need to find merge requests related to fixing broken links.

I can see there's a "Merge Requests" link in the sidebar with bid "274" that shows "Merge Requests 0". This suggests there might not be any open merge requests currently, but I should still check to see if there are any closed merge requests or if the count is inaccurate.

Let me click on the Merge Requests link to navigate to the merge requests page for this project.

```click("274")```

Looking at the current state, I can see I'm on the Merge Requests page for the empathy-prompts project, but the accessibility tree shows "Merge Requests 0" and there's a message indicating "Merge requests are a place to propose changes you've made to a project" with an illustration. This suggests there are currently no open merge requests.

However, the goal is to post "lgtm" for a merge request related to fixing broken links. Since there are no visible merge requests on this page, I should:

1. First check if there are any closed merge requests that might contain the broken links fix
2. Or check if the merge request count is inaccurate and there might be merge requests that aren't showing

Let me look for a way to filter or view all merge requests (including closed ones) since the current view might only show open ones.

```click("274")```

Looking at the current state, I can see I'm on the Merge Requests page showing "Merge Requests 0" with an illustration and explanatory text. This suggests there are currently no merge requests visible in the default view. However, the goal mentions there should be a merge request related to fixing broken links.

Since the default view might only show open merge requests, I should look for filter options to view closed or all merge requests. Unfortunately, the accessibility tree doesn't show any visible filter controls or tabs for different merge request states.

Let me try refreshing the page or checking if there are any hidden filter options that aren't visible in the current accessibility tree. I'll use the keyboard shortcut to refresh the page, which might load any missing content or update the merge request count.

```keyboard_press("ControlOrMeta+r")```

Looking at the current situation, I've already tried navigating to the merge requests page and refreshing, but I'm still seeing "Merge Requests 0" with no visible merge requests. The goal specifically mentions posting "lgtm" for a merge request related to fixing broken links, but there are no merge requests showing.

Given that:
1. I'm on the correct project page (byteblaze/empathy-prompts)
2. The merge requests page shows 0 merge requests
3. I've already tried refreshing the page

It's possible that:
- The merge request might be in a different state (closed, merged, or draft)
- The merge request might be in a different project or location
- There might be a filter applied that's hiding the merge request

Since the accessibility tree doesn't show any filter controls or tabs for different merge request states, and I've exhausted the basic navigation options, I should report that I cannot find the merge request to post "lgtm" on.

```report_infeasible("I cannot find any merge requests in the byteblaze/empathy-prompts project. The merge requests page shows 0 merge requests, and I've tried refreshing the page. The merge request related to fixing broken links might be closed, in a different state, or in a different project.")```
