Looking at the goal, I need to invite "yjlou" to the dotfiles repository as a guest. From the accessibility tree, I can see the "Byte Blaze / dotfiles" project listed. I need to first navigate to that project page, then find the members/invite section to add yjlou as a guest.

The dotfiles project link has bid "901" according to the accessibility tree. I'll click on that link to navigate to the project page first.

```click("901")```

Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see I'm already on the "Byte Blaze / dotfiles" project page (URL: http://172.26.116.102:8080/byteblaze/dotfiles). I can see various navigation options including "Settings" which is likely where I need to go to manage members and invitations.

I can see a "Settings" link with bid "395" in the sidebar. This should lead to the project settings where I can manage members and invite yjlou as a guest.

```click("395")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the "Members · Byte Blaze / dotfiles · GitLab" page (URL: http://172.26.116.102:8080/byteblaze/dotfiles/-/project_members). The accessibility tree shows the "Invite member" tab is available with a search box for selecting members to invite. I need to:

1. Search for "yjlou" in the member search box
2. Select the "Guest" role (which appears to be already selected)
3. Click the "Add to project" button

The search box for inviting members has bid "490" according to the accessibility tree. I'll start by searching for "yjlou" there.

```fill("490", "yjlou")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I've already filled "yjlou" into the member search box (bid 490), and the accessibility tree shows that there's a dropdown result available for "yjlou @yjlou" (bid 646). The "Add to project" button is currently disabled, which means I need to first select the user from the search results before I can proceed with the invitation.

The accessibility tree indicates there's a status message saying "One result is available, press enter to select it." I should press Enter to select the yjlou user from the search results.

```keyboard_press("Enter")```
