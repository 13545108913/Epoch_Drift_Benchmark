Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see there's a "Merge requests" link in the sidebar navigation that appears to be specifically filtered for merge requests assigned to me (the URL includes `assignee_username=byteblaze`). This is exactly what I need to accomplish the goal of checking out merge requests assigned to me.

The link has bid 165 and is clearly labeled "Merge requests" in the navigation menu. Clicking this will take me directly to the page showing merge requests assigned to my account.

```click("165")```
