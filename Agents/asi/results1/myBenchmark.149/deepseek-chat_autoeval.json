The agent's action history shows attempts to search for the users 'yjlou' and 'a11yproject', but the searches returned no results, and the agent reported the task as infeasible. The final state confirms that the users were not found and thus not added. Since the agent correctly identified that the users do not exist in the system and reported this, the task is appropriately handled as infeasible, which constitutes a success in terms of correctly assessing and communicating the situation.", "uid": 149}]
