[{"idx": 105, "gt": 0.0, "rm": false, "thoughts": "The user's intent is to follow three specific users on Gitlab, which is a site navigation task. The action history shows the agent searched for 'Jakub K' and 'ghost', clicked through to their profiles (likely the \"Follow\" buttons, given IDs 268 and 279), but for 'Beno\u00eet Blanchon', the agent only filled the search box and did not execute the search or navigate to the profile. The final state confirms the search for 'Beno\u00eet Blanchon' was not executed, so the agent did not complete the navigation to this user's profile and thus did not follow them. Therefore, the task is incomplete.", "uid": 105}]
