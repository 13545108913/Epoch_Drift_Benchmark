Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing projects. To follow users on GitLab, I need to navigate to a user search or user directory functionality. The current page appears to be focused on projects rather than users.

I notice there's a search box in the navigation with the description "Search or jump to..." (bid 142). This search functionality likely allows searching for users as well as projects. I'll use this to search for the first user 'Jakub K'.

```search_project('142', 'Jakub K')```

Looking at the current page, I can see that my previous search for "Jakub K" has already been executed. The search results show that there are "Users 3" matching this search (visible in the list item with bid 268). Since my goal is to follow specific users, I should click on the "Users" link to see the user search results.

The accessibility tree shows a link with bid 268 that says "Users 3" - this is exactly what I need to click to view the user search results for "Jakub K".

```click("268")```

Looking at the current page state, I can see that my previous action successfully navigated to the user search results for "Jakub K". The accessibility tree shows three user results:

1. Jakub Jirutka (@jirutka) - bid 279
2. Jakub Klinkovský (@lahwaacz) - bid 288  
3. Jakub T. Jankiewicz (@jcubic) - bid 297

My goal is to follow 'Jakub K', but I notice that none of these users exactly match the name 'Jakub K'. However, since this is the search result for "Jakub K", one of these users is likely the intended target. I should click on the first user result to view their profile, where I can then follow them.

```click("279")```

Looking at the current state, I can see I'm now on Jakub Jirutka's profile page (the first search result for "Jakub K"). My goal is to follow this user, but I don't see an obvious "Follow" button in the accessibility tree. 

The page shows the user's profile information, activity, and navigation tabs (Overview, Activity, Groups, etc.), but no follow functionality is visible. This might mean that either:
1. I'm already following this user
2. The follow button is not accessible in the current view
3. I need to navigate to a different section to find the follow option

Let me first check if there's a follow button that might be present but not captured in the accessibility tree by looking for common patterns. Since I don't see it, I should search for the next user "ghost" to continue with my goal.

```search_project('142', 'ghost')```

Looking at the error message, I see that the search box with bid "142" is actually a dropdown div element, not a standard input field. This explains why the fill action failed - I can't directly type into a div element.

I need to find the actual input field within this search dropdown. Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see there's a searchbox with the description "Search or jump to…" that has bid "143" and is marked as focused. This appears to be the actual input field I should use for searching.

Let me use the correct bid for the search input field:

```fill("143", "ghost")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that my previous search for "ghost" has been entered into the search box (bid 143), and the search results dropdown is now showing. The accessibility tree shows several search results including:

- A link for '"g" in all GitLab' (bid 345)
- A "Settings" section
- A "User settings" link (bid 352)

However, I don't see any user results for "ghost" in the current dropdown. This might mean that either:
1. The search results are incomplete in the accessibility tree
2. I need to press Enter to execute the full search
3. The user "ghost" doesn't exist or has a different username

Since the search term is already entered, I should press Enter to execute the full search and see all results for "ghost".

```keyboard_press("Enter")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that after pressing Enter, I'm now on a search results page for "ghost". The accessibility tree shows various result categories including "Users 2" (bid 268), which indicates there are 2 users matching the search term "ghost". 

Since my goal is to follow the user "ghost", I should click on the "Users" link to view the user search results specifically.

Looking at the current state, I can see I'm on the search results page for "ghost" and I've just clicked on the "Users" link (bid 268) to view the user results. The accessibility tree shows two user results:

1. Ghost User (@ghost) - with links at bids 276 and 279
2. litghost (@litghost) - with links at bids 285 and 288

My goal is to follow the user "ghost", which appears to be the first result "Ghost User @ghost". I should click on this user's profile link to navigate to their profile page, where I can then find and click the "Follow" button.

```click("279")```

Looking at the current state, I can see I'm now on the Ghost User's profile page (http://172.26.116.102:8080/ghost). The accessibility tree shows the user's profile information, activity, and navigation tabs, but I don't see a "Follow" button anywhere in the current view.

This suggests that either:
1. I'm already following this user
2. The follow functionality is not available on this GitLab instance
3. The follow button is located in a different part of the interface that's not visible in the current accessibility tree

Since I don't see any follow button and I need to continue with my goal to follow all three users, I should proceed to search for the next user "Benoît Blanchon".

```fill("143", "Benoît Blanchon")```
