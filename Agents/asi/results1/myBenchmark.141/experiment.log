Looking at the goal and the current page, I need to create a new private project called "project_site" with a NodeJS template and add three members. The current page is the GitLab projects dashboard, and I can see a "New project" link that should take me to the project creation page.

The first step is to click on the "New project" link to start the project creation process.

```click("223")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the "New Project" page (Tab 0). The page shows a tablist with three options: "Blank project", "Create from template", and "Import project". Currently, the "Blank project" tab is selected, but I need to use a NodeJS template.

I should click on the "Create from template" tab to access the template selection, then find and select the NodeJS template.

```click("242")```

Looking at the current page state, I can see that the "Create from template" tab is already focused and selected (as indicated by `focused, selected=True` in the accessibility tree). Now I need to find and select the NodeJS Express template from the available options.

I can see the NodeJS Express template in the list with the radio button labeled "Use template" (bid 357). I should click this radio button to select the NodeJS template for my project.

```click("357")```

Looking at the error message, I can see that the click on the radio button (bid 357) failed because other elements were intercepting pointer events. The radio button itself might be covered by other UI elements like the label text or help dropdown. 

Since I need to select the NodeJS Express template, I should try clicking on the label text instead of the radio button itself. The label text "Use template" has bid 358, which was mentioned as intercepting the click. Let me try clicking on the label text for the NodeJS Express template, which should also select the radio button.

```click("358")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the NodeJS Express template is already selected and visible on the page (as shown by the NodeJS Express image and text). The form fields are populated with default values, and I need to:

1. Change the project name to "project_site"
2. Ensure the project is private (which it already is based on the checked radio button)
3. Create the project
4. Then navigate to member management to add the three users

Since the template is already selected and the form is ready, I should first update the project name field to "project_site".

```fill("543", "project_site")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the project name field (bid 543) already has the value "project_site" filled in (as shown in the accessibility tree: `value='project_site'`). The NodeJS Express template is selected, and the visibility level is already set to "Private" (radio button checked). 

Since all the required settings for project creation are already configured correctly, I should proceed to create the project by clicking the "Create project" button. After the project is created, I can then navigate to member management to add the three users (primer, convexegg, vinta).

Looking at the current page state, I can see the project "project_site" has been successfully created and I'm now on the project overview page. The goal requires me to add three members (primer, convexegg, vinta) to this project. 

To add members, I need to navigate to the project settings and then to the members management section. I can see a "Settings" link in the sidebar with bid 395. Clicking this should take me to the project settings where I can manage members.

```click("395")```

This is exactly what I need to access the member management interface where I can add the three users.

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the Members management page for the project "project_site". The page shows an "Invite member" tab with a search box for selecting members to invite (bid 490), a role dropdown (bid 498), and an "Add to project" button (bid 512). 

I need to add three members: primer, convexegg, and vinta. I should use the `add_user_with_role` function to search for each user and add them with appropriate roles. Since no specific roles were mentioned in the goal, I'll use the default "Guest" role. I'll add them one by one, starting with "primer".

```add_user_with_role('490', 'primer', '498', 'Guest')```

Now I need to add the next user "convexegg" using the same process. The search box (bid 490) should still be available for searching additional users.
