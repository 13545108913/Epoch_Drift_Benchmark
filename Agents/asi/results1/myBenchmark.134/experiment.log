Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard projects page. To create a new private project called "planner" and add members Abishek and Vinta, I need to first navigate to the new project creation page. I can see there's a "New project" link on the page with bid 223.

Let me click on that link to start creating the new project.

```click("223")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the "New Project" page (Tab 0), which is exactly where I need to be to create the project. The accessibility tree shows the form is already loaded with all the necessary fields. 

I need to:
1. Fill in the project name as "planner"
2. Ensure the project is set to private (which appears to be the default based on the checked radio button)
3. Click "Create project" to create it
4. Then navigate to the project settings to add members

Let me start by filling in the project name field, which has bid 259 and is currently focused.

```fill("259", "planner")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the project name field (bid 259) already has the value "planner" filled in, and the private visibility level is already selected (radio button with bid 282 is checked). The form appears to be ready for submission.

Since the goal is to create a private project called "planner" and then add members, I should proceed with creating the project first. The "Create project" button is available with bid 310.

```click("310")```

Now I need to add Abishek and Vinta as members to this project. To do this, I need to navigate to the project settings and then to the members management section.

I can see there's a "Settings" link in the sidebar with bid 362. Clicking this will take me to the project settings where I can manage members.

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the "Members" page for the "planner" project. The accessibility tree shows the "Invite member" tab is available with a search box (bid 452) for selecting members to invite, a role dropdown (bid 460), and an "Add to project" button (bid 474).

To add Abishek and Vinta as members, I need to:
1. Search for "Abishek" in the member search box
2. Select the appropriate role (I'll use the default "Guest" role for now)
3. Click "Add to project"
4. Repeat the process for "Vinta"

Let me start by searching for and adding Abishek first.

```fill("452", "Abishek")```

The system also indicates "One result is available, press enter to select it." 

To select Abishek from the search results, I need to press Enter to confirm the selection. This will add Abishek to the invitation list and enable the "Add to project" button.

The page is still on the members management section, and the "Invite member" tab is still active with the search box ready. I need to repeat the process for Vinta:

1. Search for "Vinta" in the member search box (bid 452)
2. Select Vinta from the search results
3. Add them to the project

Let me start by searching for Vinta.

Looking at the error message, I see that the element with bid "452" is actually a `<ul>` (unordered list) element, not an input field. The accessibility tree shows that the actual search textbox has bid "455" with the description "Search for members to update or invite".

I need to use the correct element ID for the search box. Let me search for "Vinta" using the proper textbox element.

```fill("455", "Vinta")```
