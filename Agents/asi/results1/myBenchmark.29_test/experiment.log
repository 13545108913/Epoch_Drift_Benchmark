Looking at the current page state, I can see that the search for "metaseq" returned no results - there are 0 projects, 0 issues, 0 merge requests, etc. The page shows "We couldn't find any results matching metaseq". Since the search didn't find any project called "metaseq", I cannot provide the SSH clone command for a project that doesn't exist in this GitLab instance.

```send_msg_to_user("The search for 'metaseq' returned no results in this GitLab instance. There are no projects matching that name, so I cannot provide an SSH clone command. You may need to check if the project exists in this GitLab instance or if you have the correct project name.")```
