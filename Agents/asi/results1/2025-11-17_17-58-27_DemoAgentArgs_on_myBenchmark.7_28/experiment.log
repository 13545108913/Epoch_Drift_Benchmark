I need to find out how many commits Kilian made to the a11yproject on 3/5/2023. Currently, I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects, including "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com". To get commit information for a specific date and author, I need to navigate to the project's repository page and then access its commit history, likely filtering by date and author.

The first step is to click on the a11yproject.com project link to go to its repository page. From there, I can find the commit history section.

Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see the link for the a11yproject.com project with bid 286: "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com". I'll click that to proceed.

```click("286")```
