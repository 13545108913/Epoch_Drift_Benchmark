Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the GitLab dashboard showing "Your projects" with 14 projects listed. The goal is to "See all public projects". Currently, we're viewing personal projects (as indicated by the "Personal" filter being active in the navigation).

To see all public projects, I should navigate to the "Explore projects" section which typically shows publicly accessible projects across the GitLab instance. I can see there's a link for "Explore projects" in the accessibility tree with bid 234.

```click("234")```
