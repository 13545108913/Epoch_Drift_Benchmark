The action history shows the agent entered both names and pressed Enter, then clicked on the role permission combobox (bid 499). However, the final state indicates that while the names were selected, the role was still set to \"Guest\" by default, and the agent was planning to change it to \"Developer\" but did not complete that action. Since the role was not updated and the collaborators were not actually added with the correct permissions (or added at all, as the final step of confirming the addition is missing), the task is not successfully completed.", "uid": 110}]
