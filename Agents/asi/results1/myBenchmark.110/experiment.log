Looking at the goal to invite Benoît and Abishek as collaborators to my "HTML5 markup extension repo", I need to first identify which repository this refers to. From the project list, I can see several relevant repositories:

- "accessible-html-content-patterns" (description mentions "The full HTML5 Doctor Element Index as well as common markup patterns")
- "a11y-syntax-highlighting" 
- "a11y-webring.club"

The "accessible-html-content-patterns" repository seems most likely to be the HTML5 markup extension repo based on its description. I'll click on this project to navigate to its page where I can manage collaborators.

```click('697')```

Looking at the current state, I can see that both Benoît Blanchon and Abishek S have been successfully selected as members to invite (visible in the listitems with bids 775 and 946 respectively). Now I need to set their role permissions and then add them to the project. I can see the role permission combobox (bid 499) is currently set to "Guest" by default. Since these are collaborators who will likely need to contribute code, I should set them to at least "Developer" role. I'll click on the role combobox to change the permission level.
