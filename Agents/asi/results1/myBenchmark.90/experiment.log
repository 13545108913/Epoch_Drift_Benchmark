Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard in the Projects section. To create a new repository called "awesome_webagent", I need to find and click the "New project" button/link that I can see in the accessibility tree.

I can see there's a link with the text "New project" and URL "http://172.26.116.102:8080/projects/new" at position [223] in the accessibility tree. This is exactly what I need to click to start creating a new repository.

```click("223")```

Looking at the current page state, I can see I'm already on the "New Project" page in GitLab (Tab 0). The accessibility tree shows I'm on the project creation form with various input fields available. 

Since I need to create a repository called "awesome_webagent", I should:
1. Fill in the "Project name" field with "awesome_webagent"
2. The form will likely auto-populate the slug based on the name
3. Keep the repository empty (don't initialize with README as requested)
4. Click "Create project"

I can see the "Project name" textbox is focused and has bid 259. I'll fill this with the repository name.

```fill("259", "awesome_webagent")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the "Project name" field (bid 259) already has the value "awesome_webagent" filled in, and it's currently focused. The form appears to be ready for submission. Since the goal is to create an empty repository (without initializing with a README), I notice that the "Initialize repository with a README" checkbox (bid 305) is unchecked, which is correct for an empty repository.

The next logical step is to click the "Create project" button to finalize the repository creation. I can see the button with bid 310 in the accessibility tree.

```click("310")```
