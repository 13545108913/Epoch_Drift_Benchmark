Looking at the current page, I'm on a GitLab project page for "Primer / design". To create a milestone for the task of cleaning sensitive information, I need to navigate to the milestones section. I can see in the sidebar there's a "Milestones" link under the Dashboard section, which should take me to the milestones dashboard where I can create a new milestone.

```click("102")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the Milestones dashboard page. The accessibility tree shows a link with the text "Select project to create milestone" which appears to be the way to create a new milestone. This makes sense since milestones are typically created within specific projects in GitLab. I should click this link to proceed with creating the milestone for the cleaning sensitive information task.

```click("223")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the Milestones dashboard and there's a combobox element that appears to be focused and expanded, showing a list of projects. The combobox has ID "235" and is currently showing project options. Since I need to create a milestone for the cleaning sensitive information task, I should first select the appropriate project from this dropdown before proceeding to create the milestone. The "Byte Blaze / timeit" project is currently selected, but I should verify this is the correct project for the milestone.

```select_option("235", "Byte Blaze / timeit")```

Looking at the error message, I see that element "235" is not a standard `<select>` element but rather a combobox input field. The combobox is currently expanded and showing project options. Since I need to select a project to create the milestone for, I should click on one of the project options from the dropdown list. Looking at the available options, I can see "Byte Blaze / timeit" is currently selected, but I should confirm this is the correct project for the cleaning sensitive information milestone. If this is correct, I can proceed with this selection.

```click("374")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I'm on the Milestones dashboard page and I've been trying to create a new milestone. The error message from my last action indicates that element "374" wasn't found, which suggests the project selection dropdown may have closed or changed. 

I notice there's a link with the text "New milestone in timeit" (element [223]) which appears to be a direct link to create a new milestone in the "timeit" project. This seems like the most straightforward way to proceed with creating the milestone for the cleaning sensitive information task, rather than going through the project selection dropdown again.

```click("223")```
