Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing projects. To follow specific users, I need to navigate to their profiles. Since I don't see any direct user search functionality on this page, I should use the global search box to find the first user 'Jakub Klinkovský'.

The search box is available with bid 142 (from the accessibility tree: [142] searchbox 'Search or jump to…'). I'll use this to search for the first user.

```search_project('142', 'Jakub Klinkovský')```

Looking at the current page, I can see that the search for "Jakub Klinkovský" has already been executed and we're on the search results page. The accessibility tree shows that there is 1 user result available (Users 1), which is exactly what we need. I should click on the "Users 1" link to view the user search results.

The "Users 1" link has bid 268 according to the accessibility tree.

```click('268')```

Looking at the current state, I can see that we're already on the search results page for "Jakub Klinkovský" with scope=users (as shown in the URL). The search has already found 1 user result, and the user profile link for "Jakub Klinkovský @lahwaacz" is visible in the accessibility tree with bid 279.

Since we're already on the user search results page and the user profile is displayed, I should click on the user profile link to navigate to Jakub Klinkovský's profile page, where I can then follow them.

```click('279')```

Looking at the current state, I can see we're now on Jakub Klinkovský's GitLab profile page (URL: http://172.26.116.102:8080/lahwaacz). The goal is to follow this user. On GitLab user profile pages, there is typically a "Follow" button available to follow the user. However, I don't see a "Follow" button in the current accessibility tree.

Let me scan the accessibility tree more carefully for any follow-related elements. I see various navigation links like "Overview", "Activity", "Groups", etc., but no explicit "Follow" button. This could mean either:
1. The follow button is not visible in the current view and I need to scroll
2. I'm already following this user
3. The follow functionality might be located elsewhere

Since I don't see a follow button immediately, I should scroll down to see if it becomes visible, as it might be located further down the page.

```scroll(0, 300)```

Looking at the current state, I can see we're on Jakub Klinkovský's profile page but I still don't see a "Follow" button after scrolling. Let me check if there might be a follow button that's not visible in the current accessibility tree view, or if I need to look for it in a different section of the profile.

Let me scroll further down the page to see if the follow button appears in a different section, or check if there are any interactive elements that might contain the follow functionality.

```scroll(0, 500)```

Looking at the current situation, I can see we're on Jakub Klinkovský's GitLab profile page but I haven't been able to find a "Follow" button despite scrolling. Let me reconsider the approach:

1. We're currently on the profile page of the first user we need to follow ('Jakub Klinkovský')
2. The goal is to follow three users total
3. I haven't found a follow button on this profile page

Since I can't locate a follow button on this user's profile, it's possible that:
- The follow functionality might not be available on this GitLab instance
- I might need to be logged in to follow users (but there's no indication of login status)
- The follow button might be located in a different part of the interface that I haven't discovered

Given that I've tried scrolling and examining the accessibility tree without finding a follow button, I should proceed to search for the next user on the list ('Koushik') to see if the pattern persists, or if there's a different way to follow users that I'm missing.

Let me use the search functionality to find the next user:

```search_project('142', 'Koushik')```

Looking at the error message, I see that the search box with bid 142 is actually a dropdown element, not a standard input field. This explains why the fill action failed - it's not a text input element. 

Let me examine the accessibility tree more carefully. I can see there's a searchbox element with bid 143 that's marked as focused. This appears to be the actual search input field within the dropdown. Let me use this instead to search for the next user 'Koushik'.

```fill('143', 'Koushik')```

Looking at the current situation, I can see that the search for "Koushik" has already been entered in the search box (bid 143), as shown in the accessibility tree where it says "value='Koushik', focused". The search dropdown is open and showing various search results, but I need to actually execute the search to find users named Koushik.

Since the search term is already entered and the field is focused, I should press Enter to execute the search and view the search results page.

```keyboard_press('Enter')```

Since we need to follow Koushik, I should click on the "Users 1" link to view the user search results, then navigate to Koushik's profile page where I can attempt to follow them, following the same pattern we used for Jakub Klinkovský.
