Looking at the current page, I can see a list of repositories with star counts displayed next to each one. The star counts are shown as numbers immediately after the star icon image. For example:

- "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" has 21 stars
- "Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club" has 2 stars
- "Primer / design" has 21 stars
- "Byte Blaze / empathy-prompts" has 6 stars
- "Byte Blaze / millennials-to-snake-people" has 6 stars

I can see that I have contributions to repositories with different roles (Maintainer, Developer). The repositories with the most stars appear to be "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" and "Primer / design" both with 21 stars, and I have a "Developer" role in the Primer/design repository.

Based on this information, I can now provide the answer to the user.

```send_msg_to_user("The repositories where you made contributions that received the most stars are:\n\n- The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com (21 stars) - Maintainer\n- Primer / design (21 stars) - Developer\n\nBoth repositories have 21 stars, which is the highest star count among your contributed repositories.")```
