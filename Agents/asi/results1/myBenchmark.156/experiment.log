Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the GitLab dashboard in the "Projects" section. To create a new group with members, I need to navigate to the Groups section first. I can see there's a "Groups" button in the navigation sidebar with bid 76.

The goal is to create a group called "coding_friends" with members qhduan and Agnes-U, so I should first navigate to the Groups section where I can create new groups.

```click("76")```

Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see that after clicking the "Groups" button (bid 76), the groups menu expanded and now shows options including "Your groups" and "Explore groups". To create a new group, I should navigate to the groups management page where I can find the option to create a new group. The "Your groups" link (bid 83) seems like the most appropriate place to start.

```click("83")```

Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the "New Group" page with all the necessary form fields available. The goal is to create a group called "coding_friends" with members qhduan and Agnes-U. 

First, I need to fill out the group creation form with the name "coding_friends". I can see there's a focused textbox for "Group name" with bid 235. After creating the group, I'll need to add the members separately since the member addition typically happens after group creation.

```fill("235", "coding_friends")```

Looking at the current page state, I can see the group creation form is filled with "coding_friends" as the group name. The form appears to be ready for submission. The URL field (bid 245) has automatically been populated with "coding_friends" as well, which is correct. 

Since the goal requires creating the group first before adding members (member addition typically happens after group creation in GitLab), I should now submit the form to create the group. I can see the "Create group" button with bid 287.

After creating the group, I'll be able to navigate to the group's member management page to add the specified members qhduan and Agnes-U.

```click("287")```

Looking at the current page state, I can see the group "coding_friends" was successfully created (as indicated by the success message "Group 'coding_friends' was successfully created."). Now I need to add the members qhduan and Agnes-U to this group.

I can see there's a "Members" link in the group navigation sidebar with bid 291. Clicking this will take me to the member management page where I can add the specified users.

```click("291")```

Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the Members page for the "coding_friends" group. The page shows an "Add new member" section with a search box (bid 360) for finding users, a role dropdown (bid 367), and an "Add to group" button (bid 382) that is currently disabled.

To add the members qhduan and Agnes-U, I need to:
1. Search for each user in the search box
2. Select the appropriate role (default appears to be "Guest")
3. Click "Add to group" for each user

I'll start by adding the first member "qhduan" by searching for them in the search box.

```fill("360", "qhduan")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that after filling "qhduan" in the search box (bid 360), the accessibility tree shows a dropdown list with an option for "段清华DEAN @qhduan" (bid 448). This means the user was found in the search results. The status message also confirms "One result is available, press enter to select it."

To select this user from the dropdown and add them to the group, I need to press Enter to confirm the selection. This will populate the user in the form and enable the "Add to group" button.

```keyboard_press("Enter")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that after pressing Enter to select "qhduan" from the search results, the user has been added to the member addition form. The "Add to group" button (bid 382) should now be enabled since we have a valid user selected. 

The role dropdown (bid 367) shows "Guest" as the default selected role, which is acceptable for now. I should click the "Add to group" button to add qhduan as a member before proceeding to add the second user Agnes-U.

```fill("360", "Agnes-U")```
