Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on a GitLab dashboard showing various projects, but I don't see any project related to "facebook's guide on building react apps" in the visible list. I need to search for this specific repository first.

I can see there's a search box available with the description "Search or jump to…" which should allow me to search for projects. Let me use that to find the Facebook React guide repository.

```search_project('142', 'facebook react guide')```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on a search results page for "facebook react guide" but it's showing no results for projects (0 projects found). The search has already been executed with the current query. Since no projects are showing up in the results, I need to either refine my search or try a different approach to find the specific Facebook React guide repository.

Let me try a more specific search term that might match the actual repository name better.

```fill('208', 'facebook react app guide')```

Looking at the current state, I can see that my previous search for "facebook react guide" returned no project results (0 projects found). The search box currently shows "facebook react app guide" as the query. Since I'm not finding the repository through the general search, I need to consider that this might be a specific repository that requires a different search approach or might be located in a different context.

Let me try searching with a more specific term that might match Facebook's official React documentation or guide repositories. I'll try "react guide" or "create-react-app" which are more likely to be official Facebook React repositories.

```fill('208', 'create-react-app')```

Looking at the current situation, I can see that my previous searches for "facebook react guide" and "facebook react app guide" returned no project results. The current search query is "create-react-app" which is Facebook's official tool for creating React applications. However, the goal specifically asks for "facebook's guide on building react apps" which might be a different repository.

Since the search results show 0 projects for all my queries, I should check if there are any other search scopes available. I notice in the accessibility tree there are links for different search scopes like "Projects", "Issues", "Merge requests", etc. Let me try searching in the "Issues" scope since it shows "1000+" results for "facebook react guide", which might contain relevant information.

```click('256')```

Looking at the current situation, I can see that clicking on the "Issues" search scope showed many results (1000+), but these are individual issues within repositories, not the repository itself. The goal requires finding the actual repository for "facebook's guide on building react apps" and then checking its contributors.

Since the general search isn't finding the repository, I should try a more direct approach. I notice that many of the search results shown are from a repository called "Meta / create-react-app" which appears to be Facebook's Create React App repository. This might be the repository the user is referring to as "facebook's guide on building react apps."

Let me click on one of these repository links to navigate to the actual repository page, where I can then access contributor information.

```click('272')```

Looking at the current situation, I can see that I'm now on a specific issue page for the "create-react-app" repository (#7966). This confirms I'm in the correct Facebook React repository. However, I need to navigate to the main repository page to access contributor statistics, not stay on this individual issue page.

From the accessibility tree, I can see navigation elements that can take me to the main repository. Specifically, there's a link to "create-react-app" in the breadcrumb navigation that should take me to the main project page.

```click('397')```

Looking at the current state, I can see I'm now on the main "Meta / create-react-app" repository page. This appears to be Facebook's official Create React App repository, which matches the description of "facebook's guide on building react apps." 

To find the top 3 contributors ranked by number of commits, I need to navigate to the contributors page. From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a "Repository" section in the sidebar navigation (with bid 249), and within that, there should be a way to access contributor statistics. However, I don't see a direct "Contributors" link in the current view.

Let me first click on the "Repository" section to see what options are available, as this is where contributor statistics are typically located in GitLab interfaces.

```click('249')```

Looking at the current state, I can see I'm in the "Meta / create-react-app" repository page. I successfully navigated to the repository section by clicking on the "Repository" link. Now I need to access the contributor statistics to find the top 3 contributors by number of commits.

From the accessibility tree, I can see that within the Repository section, there's a submenu with various options including "Contributors" (with bid 268). This is exactly what I need to access the contributor statistics page.

```click('268')```

Looking at the current state, I can see I'm now on the "Contributors" page for the "Meta / create-react-app" repository. The accessibility tree shows a list of contributors with their names and commit counts. I can see the top contributors are:

1. Dan Abramov - 358 commits
2. Ville Immonen - 49 commits  
3. Joe Haddad - 35 commits

The goal is to list the names of the top 3 contributors ranked by number of commits. Since I can see this information clearly displayed on the current page, I should now send this information to the user.

```send_msg_to_user("The top 3 contributors to Meta/create-react-app repository by number of commits are:\n1. Dan Abramov (358 commits)\n2. Ville Immonen (49 commits)\n3. Joe Haddad (35 commits)")```
