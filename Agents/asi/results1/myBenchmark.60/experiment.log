Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. I need to find the "MetaSeq" project to fork it. Since I don't see "MetaSeq" in the currently visible project list, I should search for it using the search functionality.

I can see there's a search box with the description "Search or jump to…" which has bid 142. I'll use this to search for the MetaSeq project.

```search_project('142', 'metaseq')```

Looking at the current state, I can see that my previous search for "metaseq" has already been executed. The search results show "Projects 0", "Issues 0", "Merge requests 0", etc., indicating that no projects named "metaseq" were found in the search. The page even displays a message saying "We couldn't find any results matching metaseq".

Since the search didn't find any projects with the name "metaseq", I cannot proceed with forking it as the project doesn't appear to exist in this GitLab instance. I should inform the user about this result.

```send_msg_to_user("The search for 'metaseq' returned no results. No projects with this name were found in the GitLab instance, so I cannot fork it.")```
