Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the GitLab dashboard with a list of existing projects. To create a new repository called "chatgpt_plugin", I need to find and click the "New project" link that's visible in the accessibility tree.

I can see there's a link with the text "New project" and URL "http://172.26.116.102:8080/projects/new" at position [223] in the accessibility tree. This should take me to the project creation page where I can set up the new repository.

```click("223")```

Looking at the current page state, I can see we're already on the "New Project" page in GitLab (URL: http://172.26.116.102:8080/projects/new). The accessibility tree shows we have a form with various fields to create a new project. 

Since the goal is to create a new repository named "chatgpt_plugin", I need to:
1. Fill in the "Project name" field with "chatgpt_plugin"
2. The "Project slug" field will likely auto-populate based on the project name
3. Click the "Create project" button

I can see the project name textbox is focused and has bid 259. I'll fill this with the repository name.

```fill("259", "chatgpt_plugin")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the project name field (bid 259) already has the value "chatgpt_plugin" populated, as shown in the accessibility tree. This means my previous fill action was successful. 

Now I need to proceed with creating the project. The form appears to be complete - the project name is set, the project slug has auto-populated to "chatgpt_plugin", and the visibility level is set to "Private" by default. Since we want an empty repository, I should leave the "Initialize repository with a README" checkbox unchecked (which it currently is).

The final step is to click the "Create project" button, which has bid 310.

```click("310")```
