The agent's action history shows repeated clicks and escape key presses, but the final state indicates the agent is stuck in a loop with a dropdown blocking the \"New milestone\" button. The agent's own analysis in the final state admits the dropdown persists and suggests trying a different approach, but no successful milestone creation is evident.
