Looking at the current page, I'm on a GitLab project page for "Primer / design". To create a milestone for the upcoming product launch, I need to navigate to the milestones section. I can see in the sidebar there's a "Milestones" link under the dashboard section (bid 102). This should take me to the milestones dashboard where I can create a new milestone.

```click("102")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the Milestones dashboard page. I need to create a new milestone for the product launch. I notice there's a link that says "Select project to create milestone" (bid 223), which seems to be the entry point for creating a new milestone. I should click on this to proceed with creating the milestone.

```click("223")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the Milestones dashboard and there's a combobox element (bid 235) that appears to be focused and expanded, showing a list of projects. This is likely the project selection interface for creating a new milestone. Since I need to create a milestone for the product launch, I should select a project first. Looking at the available options, "Byte Blaze / timeit" is currently selected, but I should choose an appropriate project for the product launch milestone. Let me select "Byte Blaze / timeit" since it's already selected and appears to be my main project.

```select_option("235", "Byte Blaze / timeit")```

Looking at the error message, I see that element 235 is not a standard `<select>` element but rather a combobox with an input field. The combobox is currently focused and expanded, showing a list of projects. Since I need to select a project to create the milestone for, and "Byte Blaze / timeit" is already selected (as indicated by "selected=True" in the accessibility tree), I should proceed by pressing Enter to confirm this selection, or simply move to the next step of creating the milestone.

However, I notice that the link "Select project to create milestone" (bid 223) that I clicked earlier might have triggered this project selection combobox. Since the combobox is already open with a project selected, I should press Enter to confirm the selection and proceed to the milestone creation form.

```keyboard_press("Enter")```

Looking at the current state, I can see I'm on the Milestones dashboard page. I notice there's a link that says "New milestone in timeit" (bid 223) which appears to be the direct link to create a new milestone for the "timeit" project. Since my goal is to create a milestone for the product launch, I should click this link to go directly to the milestone creation form rather than going through the project selection process again.

```click("223")```
