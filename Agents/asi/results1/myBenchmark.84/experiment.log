Looking at the current page, I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing projects. To set my homepage URL in my GitLab profile, I need to navigate to my user profile settings. I can see there's a link to my profile in the top navigation - it's the link with my username "byteblaze" that has an avatar image. Let me click on that to access my profile page first.

```click("186")```

Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see that after clicking on my profile link (bid 186), a dropdown menu has appeared with options including "Profile" and "Settings". To set my homepage URL, I need to access the settings where I can edit my profile information. The "Settings" link (bid 202) should take me to the profile settings page where I can modify my homepage URL.

```click("202")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the User Settings page (specifically the Profile section). The accessibility tree shows a form with various profile fields, including a "Website url" field (bid 481) that currently has the value "a11yproject.contributor.me". This is exactly where I need to update the homepage URL to "www.byteblaze.com".

```fill("481", "www.byteblaze.com")```
