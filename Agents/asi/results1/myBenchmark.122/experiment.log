Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. I need to create an issue in the "empathy-prompts" repository. I can see the "empathy-prompts" project listed in the project list with the description "Ideas to help consider Inclusive Design principles when making things for others to use."

To create an issue, I first need to navigate to the empathy-prompts project page. I can see the link to the empathy-prompts project in the list.

```click("632")```

Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the empathy-prompts project page in GitLab. The page shows that the repository is empty and provides options to create files, but I need to create an issue. I can see in the navigation that there's an "Issues" link with a count of "6" issues already in the project.

To create a new issue, I need to navigate to the issues page first, then find the button to create a new issue.

```click("252")```

Looking at the current state, I can see we're now on the Issues page for the empathy-prompts repository. I can see a list of existing issues and various navigation elements. To create a new issue, I need to find and click the "New issue" button that should be available on this page.

In the accessibility tree, I can see there's a link with the text "New issue" at position [453]. This is exactly what I need to click to start creating a new issue.

```click("453")```

Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the "New Issue" page for the empathy-prompts repository. The form is already loaded with fields for title, description, assignee, milestone, labels, and due date. 

I need to:
1. Fill in the title with "Integrating LLMs for better prompts"
2. Assign the issue to Roshanjossey
3. Set the due date to the beginning of Q2 2033 (which would be April 1, 2033)

The title field is already focused and ready for input. I'll start by filling in the title.

```fill("440", "Integrating LLMs for better prompts")```

Looking at the current state, I can see the title has been successfully filled with "Integrating LLMs for better prompts". Now I need to assign the issue to Roshanjossey. I can see there's an "Assignee" section with a button that currently shows "Unassigned" (bid 533). I need to click this button to open the assignee selection dropdown so I can search for and select Roshanjossey.

```click("533")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that after clicking the "Unassigned" button, the assignee dropdown has opened. I can see a search box (bid 542) that is currently focused and ready for input. I need to search for "Roshanjossey" in this search box to find and assign them to the issue.

```fill("542", "Roshanjossey")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I've filled "Roshanjossey" into the assignee search box, but the accessibility tree shows "No matching results" in the dropdown list. This suggests that either the user "Roshanjossey" doesn't exist in this GitLab instance, or there might be a different username format needed. 

Since the search didn't find any matching users, I should clear the search and try to see if there are other available assignees, or proceed without assigning if the user isn't found. Let me clear the search field first.

```fill("542", "")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that after searching for "Roshanjossey" in the assignee field, no matching results were found. The error message "ZeroDivisionError: division by zero" appears to be unrelated to the GitLab interface and might be a system error.

Since "Roshanjossey" doesn't appear to exist as a user in this GitLab instance, I should proceed with creating the issue without assigning it to that specific user. The next step is to set the due date to the beginning of Q2 2033 (April 1, 2033). I can see there's a due date field (bid 649) that I need to fill.

```fill("649", "2033-04-01")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the due date field (bid 649) already shows "2033-04-01" which is exactly the beginning of Q2 2033 as requested. This means the due date has already been successfully set. 

Since the title is filled ("Integrating LLMs for better prompts"), the due date is set correctly, and we couldn't assign to Roshanjossey (user not found), the only remaining step is to submit the issue. I can see the "Submit issue" button (bid 655) at the bottom of the form.

```click("655")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the issue creation was successful - we're now on the issue page for "#16: Integrating LLMs for better prompts" in the empathy-prompts repository. The issue has been created with the correct title and the due date is already set to April 1, 2033 as requested.

However, I notice that the assignee is still showing as "None" in the sidebar, which means the issue was not assigned to Roshanjossey. This is because the user "Roshanjossey" was not found in the system when we searched earlier.

Since the main goal of creating the issue with the specified title and due date has been accomplished, and the assignment couldn't be completed due to the user not existing in this GitLab instance, I should notify the user about the successful creation and the assignment issue.

```send_msg_to_user("Successfully created issue 'Integrating LLMs for better prompts' with due date April 1, 2033. However, the user 'Roshanjossey' was not found in the system, so the issue could not be assigned to them.")```
