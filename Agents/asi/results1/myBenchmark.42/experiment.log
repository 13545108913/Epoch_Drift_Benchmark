Looking at the current page, I can see the GitLab dashboard with a list of projects. I need to find the "prime/design" repository and then navigate to its contributors page to get the top 3 contributors by commit count.

I can see the "Primer / design" project in the list (bid 354). I should click on this link to navigate to the project page first, then find the contributors statistics from there.

```click("354")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the Contributors page for the Primer/design repository. The accessibility tree shows a list of contributors with their commit counts, ranked from highest to lowest. I can see the top 3 contributors are:

1. Shawn Allen - 95 commits
2. Inayaili León - 77 commits  
3. Aurora Pleguezuelo - 66 commits

Since I have the information requested, I should send it to the user.

```send_msg_to_user("The top 3 contributors to the prime/design repo by number of commits are: 1. Shawn Allen (95 commits), 2. Inayaili León (77 commits), 3. Aurora Pleguezuelo (66 commits)")```
