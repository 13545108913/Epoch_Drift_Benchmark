Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the GitLab dashboard in the Projects view. To create a new group with members, I need to navigate to the Groups section first. I can see there's a "Groups" button in the navigation sidebar.

The next step is to click on the "Groups" button to access the groups management area, where I can then create a new group.

```click("76")```

Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the "New Group" page with the form ready to be filled out. The goal is to create a group named "crew" and add specific members.

Looking at the current state, I can see the group creation form is already filled with "crew" as the group name and URL. The form appears to be ready for submission. Since the goal is to create a group named "crew" with specific members, I should first create the group by clicking the "Create group" button (bid 287). After the group is created, I can then navigate to the group's member management section to add the specified users.

Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the Members page for the "crew" group. The accessibility tree shows a search box for adding new members (bid 360) and a role dropdown (bid 367). I need to add the four specified members one by one. I'll start by searching for the first user "ASWATFZLLC" in the search box, then select an appropriate role (likely "Developer" or "Maintainer" since no specific role was mentioned), and click the "Add to group" button. I'll repeat this process for each member.

I'll select "Developer" for now, then click "Add to group" to add this first member.
