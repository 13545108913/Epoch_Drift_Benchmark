Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard projects page. To create a new private project called "llm_bulk_inference" and add members, I need to first navigate to the new project creation page. I can see there's a "New project" link available in the accessibility tree.

The next logical step is to click on the "New project" link to start the project creation process.

```click("223")```

Looking at the current page state, I can see I'm already on the "New Project" page (Tab 0). The accessibility tree shows the project creation form is loaded with various fields including:

- Project name textbox (bid 259, focused)
- Project slug textbox (bid 270, required)
- Visibility level radio buttons (Private is already checked)
- Create project button (bid 310)

Since I'm already on the correct page, I should fill in the project details to create the "llm_bulk_inference" project first. The visibility is already set to Private as required. After creating the project, I can then navigate to add the members.

```fill("259", "llm_bulk_inference")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the project name field (bid 259) already has the value "llm_bulk_inference" filled in, as shown in the accessibility tree. The project slug is also automatically populated with the same value. The visibility level is already set to Private, which matches the goal requirements.

Since all the basic project creation fields are already correctly filled out, the next step is to create the project by clicking the "Create project" button. After the project is created, I can then navigate to the project settings to add the specified members (primer, convexegg, abishek).

```click("310")```

Looking at the current page state, I can see the project "llm_bulk_inference" was successfully created (as indicated by the message "Project 'llm_bulk_inference' was successfully created."). Now I need to add the members (primer, convexegg, abishek) to this project.

To add members, I need to navigate to the project's member management settings. I can see in the accessibility tree there's a "Settings" link (bid 361) in the sidebar. Clicking this should take me to the project settings where I can then access the member management section.

```click("361")```

To add the specified members (primer, convexegg, abishek), I need to navigate to the Members management section. The "Members" link is clearly visible in the settings sidebar. Clicking this will take me to the page where I can search for and add users to the project.

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the "Members" page for the "llm_bulk_inference" project. The accessibility tree shows:

- A search box for "Select members to invite" (bid 452)
- A role dropdown (bid 460) currently set to "Guest"
- An "Add to project" button (bid 474) that is currently disabled
- The "Invite member" tab is active

To add the members (primer, convexegg, abishek), I need to use the search functionality to find each user and add them with appropriate roles. Since the goal doesn't specify roles, I'll use the default "Guest" role. I'll start by searching for the first user "primer" in the member search box.

```fill("452", "primer")```

Now I need to select this user from the dropdown by pressing Enter, which will populate the user in the search field and enable the "Add to project" button. After selecting the user, I can then add them to the project.

```keyboard_press("Enter")```

Now I need to add the remaining users "convexegg" and "abishek". I'll continue using the same member invitation interface. The search box (bid 452) is still available, so I can search for the next user "convexegg".

Looking at the error message, I see that the element with bid "452" is actually a `<ul>` (unordered list) element, not a text input field. This means I was trying to fill a non-input element. 

Looking back at the accessibility tree, I can see that the actual search textbox has bid "455" with the description "textbox 'Select members to invite' value='Search for members to update or invite'". This is the correct element to fill for searching members.

I need to use the correct textbox bid "455" instead of "452" to search for the next user "convexegg".

```fill("455", "convexegg")```
