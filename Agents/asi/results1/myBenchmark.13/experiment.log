Looking at the current page, I can see a list of repositories with star counts displayed next to each one. The star counts I can see are: 21, 2, 21, 0, 2, 6, 0, 0, 1, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0. None of these repositories have more than 100 stars. However, I notice there are 14 total projects listed, and I can only see a portion of them on this page. I should scroll down to see if there are more repositories that might have higher star counts.

```scroll(0, 500)```

Looking at the current page, I can see several repositories with star counts displayed, but none exceed 100 stars (the highest I see is 21). However, the page indicates there are 14 total projects, and I can only see a portion of them in the current view. Since I need to find repositories with more than 100 stars where I made contributions, I should scroll further down to see if there are additional repositories that might meet this criteria.

```scroll(0, 500)```

Looking at the current page, I can see several repositories with star counts displayed, but none exceed 100 stars (the highest I see is 21). The page indicates there are 14 total projects, and I've already scrolled twice but still only see repositories with low star counts. Since I need to find repositories with more than 100 stars where I made contributions, and none are visible in the current view, I should check if there are more repositories by continuing to scroll down the page.

Looking at the current page, I can see several repositories with star counts displayed, but none exceed 100 stars (the highest I see is 21). I've already scrolled down multiple times and can see all 14 projects listed in the accessibility tree. Since none of these repositories have more than 100 stars, and I've confirmed this by reviewing all visible projects, I should conclude that there are no repositories meeting the criteria of having more than 100 stars where I made contributions.

```send_msg_to_user("Based on my review of all 14 repositories in your GitLab dashboard, none of them have more than 100 stars. The repositories with the highest star counts are 'The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com' and 'Primer / design', both with 21 stars.")```
