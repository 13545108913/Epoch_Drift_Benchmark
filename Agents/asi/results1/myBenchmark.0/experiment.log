Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see there's a "Todos" link in the navigation sidebar with a badge showing "7" (indicating 7 pending todos). Since the goal is to check out todos, I should click on this link to navigate to the todos page.

The Todos link has bid 169 and is located in the navigation menu under the list item with bid 168. I'll click on this link to view the todos.

```click("169")```
