Looking at the current page, I can see the GitLab dashboard with a list of projects. I need to find the specific repository "gimmiethat.space" and then navigate to its settings or members page to see who has access. I can see "Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space" in the project list, so I should click on that link to go to the project page first.

The project "Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space" has a link with bid 484 according to the accessibility tree. I'll click on that to navigate to the project page where I can then find the members/access settings.

```click("484")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the "Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space" project page. To find who has access to this repository, I need to navigate to the project settings where member information is typically located. I can see a "Settings" link in the sidebar with bid 392. This should lead me to the project settings where I can find member access information.

```click("392")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already in the Settings section of the "gimmiethat.space" repository. The accessibility tree shows a "Members" link under the Settings section with bid 404. This is exactly what I need to see who else has access to the repository. I should click on this "Members" link to view the project members and their usernames.

```click("404")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the "Members" page for the "gimmiethat.space" repository. The accessibility tree shows an "Existing members and groups" section that lists two members: "Byte Blaze" (which is you) and "yjlou". The information is clearly displayed - "yjlou" has "Developer" access to the repository. Since the goal is to show who else has access to the repo, I can now send this information to the user.

```send_msg_to_user("The users who have access to your repository 'gimmiethat.space' are: Byte Blaze (you, Maintainer) and yjlou (Developer).")```
