Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard projects page. To create a new public project called "awesome-llms" and add members, I need to first navigate to the new project creation page. I can see there's a "New project" link with URL '/projects/new' that should take me to the project creation form.

```click("223")```

Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see I'm already on the "New Project" page (Tab 0). The page shows a form with fields for creating a new project. I need to:

1. Fill in the project name as "awesome-llms"
2. Set the visibility level to "Public" 
3. Click "Create project" to create it
4. Then navigate to member settings to add the users

The project name field is focused and has bid 259. I'll start by filling in the project name.

```fill("259", "awesome-llms")```

Looking at the current state, I can see the project name field (bid 259) already has the value "awesome-llms" filled in. Now I need to set the project visibility to "Public" as specified in the goal. I can see there are three radio buttons for visibility levels:

- Private (currently checked)
- Internal 
- Public

The "Public" radio button has bid 296. I need to click this to make the project public.

```click("296")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that:

1. The project name "awesome-llms" is already filled in the textbox (bid 259)
2. The "Public" visibility radio button (bid 296) is already checked (focused and checked='true')
3. The form appears to be ready for submission

Since both the project name and public visibility are already set correctly, I can now proceed to create the project by clicking the "Create project" button, which has bid 310. After the project is created, I'll need to navigate to the member settings to add the specified users (primer, convexegg, abishek).

```click("310")```

Now I need to add the members primer, convexegg, and abishek to this project. To do this, I need to navigate to the project settings and then to the members management section.

From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a "Settings" link with bid 362 that should take me to the project settings page where I can manage members.

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the "Members" page for the awesome-llms project. The page shows:

1. An "Invite member" section with:
   - A search box for "Select members to invite" (bid 452)
   - A role dropdown (bid 460) currently set to "Guest"
   - An "Add to project" button (bid 474) that is currently disabled

2. An "Existing members and groups" section showing only the current user (byteblaze)

I need to add three members: primer, convexegg, and abishek. I'll start by searching for and adding the first user "primer" with an appropriate role (I'll use "Developer" as a reasonable default since no specific role was specified in the goal).

```fill("452", "primer")```
