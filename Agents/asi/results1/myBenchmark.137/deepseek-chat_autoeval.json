The action history shows that the agent filled in the project name and clicked to create it, then began adding members by searching for \"primer\", setting the role to \"Developer\", and clicking \"Add to project\". However, the final state indicates that only \"primer\" has been added so far, and the agent acknowledges that the other two members still need to be added. Since the task requires adding all three members and the agent has not completed this, the execution is incomplete and thus unsuccessful.", "uid": 137}]
