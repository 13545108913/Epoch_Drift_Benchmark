Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard in the Projects section. To create a new repository called "awesome_program_aided_reasoning", I need to click on the "New project" button that's visible in the accessibility tree.

The "New project" link has bid 284 according to the accessibility tree, which will take me to the project creation page where I can set up the new repository.
