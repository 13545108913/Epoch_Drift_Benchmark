Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. The goal is to fork all source repos from Akilesh Kannan. 

First, I need to find Akilesh Kannan's profile or repositories. Since I'm currently on my own dashboard showing my projects, I should search for Akilesh Kannan to find their repositories.

I can see there's a search box available in the navigation with bid '156' that says "Search or jump to...". This would be the appropriate place to search for users or repositories.

```click("156")```

Looking at the current state, I've clicked on the search box (bid '156') but haven't entered any search query yet. Since I need to find Akilesh Kannan's repositories to fork them, I should now search for "Akilesh Kannan" in the search box.

```fill("156", "Akilesh Kannan")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I've filled the search box with "Akilesh Kannan" but haven't executed the search yet. The accessibility tree shows that the search box already has the value "Akilesh Kannan" and there's a dropdown list with search results including a link for '"Akilesh Kannan" in all GitLab'. 

Since the search results are already visible in the dropdown, I should click on the search result link to navigate to Akilesh Kannan's profile or search results page.

```click("1033")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that my previous search for "Akilesh Kannan" has returned results, but the page is showing "We couldn't find any projects matching Akilesh Kannan". This suggests that either there are no projects directly matching this search term, or I need to adjust my search approach.

Since the goal is to fork all source repos from Akilesh Kannan, I should try a different search strategy. Instead of searching for the name as a project, I should search for the user directly. I notice there are different search categories in the results list - "Projects", "Issues", "Merge requests", "Milestones", and "Users". I should click on the "Users" link to search specifically for the user profile.

```click("325")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that after clicking "Users", the search results now show one user result: "Akilesh Kannan @aklsh". This is exactly what I need to find Akilesh Kannan's repositories. I should click on this user link to navigate to their profile page where I can see their repositories and fork them.

```click("336")```

Looking at the current state, I can see I've successfully navigated to Akilesh Kannan's profile page. The page shows their personal projects including "dots", "SimCache", "viewgrades-scraper", "nvidia-patch", "CacheEval", and "empathy-prompts". 

To fork all these source repos, I need to go through each project and fork them individually. I'll start with the first project "dots" by clicking on its link.

```click("365")```

Looking at the current state, I can see I'm now on the "dots" project page that belongs to Akilesh Kannan. I can see the "Fork" button/link with bid '594' in the accessibility tree. To fork this repository, I need to click on this "Fork" button.

```click("594")```

Looking at the current state, I can see I'm on the "Fork project" page for the "dots" repository. The page shows various namespace options where I can fork the project to, including "Byte Blaze" (my personal namespace) and several groups like "n-lab", "x-lab", "crew", etc. 

Since I want to fork all of Akilesh Kannan's repositories to my personal account, I should select my personal namespace "Byte Blaze" to fork this repository. I can see there's a "Select" button next to "Byte Blaze" with bid '509'.

```click("509")```

Looking at the error message, it appears the click action on bid '509' actually succeeded despite the timeout error - the log shows the click was performed and completed. The timeout likely occurred while waiting for navigation to complete after the click.

Since I've successfully clicked the "Select" button to fork the "dots" repository to my "Byte Blaze" namespace, the fork operation should now be in progress. I should wait a moment for the fork to complete and then navigate back to Akilesh Kannan's profile to continue forking the remaining repositories.

Looking at the current state, I successfully forked the "dots" repository to my personal namespace. Now I need to continue forking the remaining repositories from Akilesh Kannan's profile. I should navigate back to their profile page to access the other repositories.

I can use the browser's back button to return to Akilesh Kannan's profile page where I saw the list of their repositories.

```go_back()```
