Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see this is a GitLab project page for "GIVE ME SPACE". The goal is to update the project site's title to "Welcome to my site". 

I can see there's an `index.html` file listed in the repository files (line 952-961), which is likely the main page that contains the site title. To update the title, I need to edit this file. I can see there's a "Web IDE" link (line 774-775) that would allow me to edit files directly in the browser.

Let me click on the "Web IDE" link to open the editor where I can modify the index.html file.

```click("774")```

Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see that I'm already in the GitLab Web IDE (the active tab shows "IDE · GitLab"). The file listing shows various files including `index.html` (bid 751). Since I need to update the project site's title, I should open and edit the `index.html` file, as it's likely the main page that contains the title tag.

Let me click on the `index.html` file to open it in the editor.

```click("751")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the `index.html` file is already open in the editor tab (bid 836-845 shows the tab is selected). The accessibility tree shows the editor content (bid 1404) contains the current title tag: `<title>gimmiethat/space</title>`. 

I need to edit this title to "Welcome to my site". Since the textbox is already focused and showing the content, I can directly modify the text by selecting the current title and replacing it.

I'll use the keyboard shortcut to select all text (Control+A or Command+A) to ensure I can easily replace the content, then type the new HTML with the updated title.

```keyboard_press("ControlOrMeta+a")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I've already selected all the content in the editor using the keyboard shortcut. Now I need to replace the selected content with the updated HTML that includes the new title "Welcome to my site". I can see the current content includes the entire HTML structure, so I'll replace it with the same structure but with the updated title.

```fill("1404", "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Webpage\">\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n  <meta http-equiv=\"x-ua-compatible\" content=\"ie=edge\" />\n  <meta http-equiv=\"cleartype\" content=\"on\" />\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n  <title>Welcome to my site</title>\n  <meta name=\"description\" content=\"I need some space\">\n</head>\n<body>\n</body>\n</html>")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I've successfully replaced the content of the index.html file with the updated title "Welcome to my site". Now I need to commit these changes to make them live on the project site. I can see there's a "Commit..." button (bid 791) in the interface that I should click to proceed with committing the changes.

The commit interface is now visible with a commit message field (bid 1772) showing "Update index.html" as the default message, and commit options configured. 

To finalize the change and make it live on the project site, I need to click the "Commit" button (bid 1794) to save and deploy the changes.

Looking at the current state, I can see that the commit was successful - the accessibility tree shows a "Commit was successfully created" message (line 2908) and the interface has returned to the file listing view. The title has been successfully updated to "Welcome to my site" in the index.html file and the changes have been committed to the repository.

The goal has been accomplished - I've updated the project site's title to "Welcome to my site" by editing the index.html file and committing the changes. The site should now display the new title.

```send_msg_to_user("Successfully updated the project site's title to 'Welcome to my site'. The changes have been committed and should now be live on the site.")```
