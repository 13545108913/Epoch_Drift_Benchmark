Looking at the current page, I can see several PyTorch-GAN repositories listed in the projects dashboard. The goal is to clone the best GAN implementation using SSH. I need to first identify which repository is the best one, then navigate to its page to get the SSH clone command.

From the accessibility tree, I can see multiple PyTorch-GAN repositories:
- "Byte Blaze / PyTorch-GAN" (bid 513)
- "coding_friends / PyTorch-GAN" (bid 747) 
- "crew / PyTorch-GAN" (bid 779)
- "x-lab / PyTorch-GAN" (bid 811)
- "n-lab / PyTorch-GAN" (bid 875)

The "Byte Blaze / PyTorch-GAN" appears to be the original/main repository since it's listed first and has the same description as the others. I should click on this one to get to its project page where I can find the SSH clone command.

```click("513")```

Looking at the current page after clicking on the Byte Blaze PyTorch-GAN repository, I can see we're now on the project page. The goal is to get the SSH clone command. I can see there's a "Clone" button/link with bid 834 in the accessibility tree. This should reveal the clone options including the SSH URL.

I need to click on this "Clone" element to see the clone options and get the SSH command.

```click("834")```

Looking at the current page state after clicking the "Clone" button, I can see that the clone options are now expanded and visible. In the accessibility tree, I can see the SSH clone URL is displayed with the value "git@localhost:byteblaze/PyTorch-GAN.git" in a textbox with bid 841.

The goal is to show the SSH clone command to the user. Since the SSH URL is now visible on the page, I should send this information to the user so they can use it to clone the repository.

```send_msg_to_user("The SSH command to clone the PyTorch-GAN repository is: git clone git@localhost:byteblaze/PyTorch-GAN.git")```
