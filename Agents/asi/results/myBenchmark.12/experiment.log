Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the GitLab dashboard with a "Merge requests" link in the navigation sidebar that shows "1" (indicating there's 1 merge request assigned to me). Since the goal is to checkout merge requests assigned to me, the most direct action is to click on the "Merge requests" link in the navigation menu.

The accessibility tree shows the merge requests link has bid "182" and contains the text "Merge requests" with a badge showing "1".

```click("182")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the "Merge requests" link in the navigation sidebar is already expanded (expanded=True in the accessibility tree), and there's a submenu visible with options including "Assigned to you 1". Since the goal is specifically to checkout merge requests assigned to me, I should click directly on the "Assigned to you" link rather than the general "Merge requests" link.

The "Assigned to you" link has bid "190" according to the accessibility tree.

```click("190")```
