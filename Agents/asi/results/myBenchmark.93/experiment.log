Looking at the goal to invite "yjlou" to the dotfile repository as a guest, I can see from the accessibility tree that there are multiple dotfile-related repositories listed:
- "Byte Blaze / dots" (updated 2 minutes ago)
- "Byte Blaze / dotfiles" (updated 7 hours ago)

Since the goal mentions "dotfile configurations" and both could be relevant, I should navigate to one of these repositories first to access the member management settings. I'll start with the "Byte Blaze / dots" repository since it was more recently updated and the description mentions "files that define my system settings" which aligns with dotfile configurations.

I need to click on the "Byte Blaze / dots" repository link to navigate to its project page.

```click("384")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the "Byte Blaze / dots" repository page (Tab 0). The accessibility tree shows this is the project overview page with repository files visible. To invite "yjlou" as a guest, I need to navigate to the member management settings.

From the sidebar navigation, I can see there's a "Members" link available. This is exactly what I need to access the member invitation interface.

```click("513")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the Members page for the "dots" repository (as indicated by the URL and the "Project members" heading). The accessibility tree shows the invitation interface is already visible with:

- A search box for "GitLab member or Email address" (bid 616)
- A role dropdown set to "Guest" by default (bid 624)
- An "Invite" button (bid 638, currently disabled)

Since the role is already set to "Guest" by default, I just need to search for "yjlou" in the member search box to enable the invite button.

```fill("616", "yjlou")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I've already filled "yjlou" into the member search box (bid 616). The accessibility tree shows that the textbox currently has the value 'yjlou' and is focused. 

I notice in the accessibility tree there's also a list with an option for 'yjlou @yjlou' (bid 871), which suggests the search has found the user. However, the "Invite" button (bid 638) is still disabled. This typically means I need to select the user from the search results to enable the invite button.

The most logical next step is to select the found user "yjlou @yjlou" from the dropdown results.

```click("871")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I've successfully filled "yjlou" in the search box and selected the user from the dropdown results. The accessibility tree shows the role is already set to "Guest" by default, which matches the goal requirement. 

Now the "Invite" button should be enabled and ready to use. I need to click it to complete the invitation process.

```click("638")```

Looking at the current state, I can see from the accessibility tree that there's a success message displayed: "Users were successfully added." This indicates that the invitation to yjlou has already been completed successfully. The tree also shows yjlou is now listed as a member with Guest role in the members table, with access granted "just now" by Byte Blaze.

Since the goal has already been accomplished (yjlou has been invited as a guest to the dots repository), I should inform the user that the task is complete.

```send_msg_to_user("Successfully invited yjlou to the dots repository as a guest. They now appear in the project members list with Guest access.")```
