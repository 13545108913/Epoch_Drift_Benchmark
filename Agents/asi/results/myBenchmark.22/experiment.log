Looking at the current page, I can see we're on a GitLab repository page for "a11yproject.com". The goal is to find how many commits "kilian" made on 3/5/2023. 

I can see there's a "History" link on the page (bid 778), which likely leads to the commit history. From there, I should be able to filter or search for commits by "kilian" and then look for those made on March 5, 2023.

Let me first navigate to the commit history page.

```click("778")```

Looking at the current page, I can see we're already on the commits page for the "add-color-utility-classes" branch. The commits displayed are from 2020, which is much earlier than the target date of March 5, 2023. 

I need to find commits by "kilian" on 3/5/2023. Since the current view only shows older commits, I should:

1. First, use the search functionality to find commits by "kilian"
2. Then look for commits from March 5, 2023

I can see there's a search box with the text "Search by message" (bid 642). I can use this to search for commits by author "kilian" by using the author filter syntax in GitLab.

```fill("642", "author:kilian")```

Looking at the current page state, I can see that my previous action filled the search box with "author:kilian" but the results show "Your search didn't match any commits." This suggests that either:

1. There are no commits by "kilian" in this branch
2. The search needs to be executed by pressing Enter
3. We need to look at a different branch or the entire repository

Since the search box is already filled with "author:kilian" and is focused, I should press Enter to execute the search and see if there are any results.

```keyboard_press("Enter")```

Looking at the current page state, I can see that after searching for "author:kilian" and pressing Enter, the results show "Your search didn't match any commits." This means there are no commits by "kilian" in the current branch "add-color-utility-classes".

Since the goal is to find commits by "kilian" on 3/5/2023, I need to broaden my search beyond this specific branch. I should navigate to the main repository commits page where I can see all commits across all branches, then search for "kilian" there.

I can see in the navigation sidebar there's a "Commits" link under the "Repository" section (bid 320). This should take me to the repository-wide commits view.

```click("320")```

Looking at the error message, it seems the click action timed out even though the element was found and appeared to be clickable. The element with bid "320" is a "Commits" link in the repository navigation sidebar. Since this is a navigation action, I should try again with a longer timeout or use a different approach.

Let me check the current page state again. I can see in the accessibility tree that there's a "Commits" link with bid 302 under the Repository section. This might be the correct link to navigate to the repository-wide commits view. Let me try clicking this instead.

```click("302")```

Looking at the error message, the click action on bid "302" timed out even though the element was found and appeared to be clickable. This suggests there might be a loading issue or the page is taking longer to respond than the default timeout.

Since we're trying to navigate to the repository-wide commits view to search for "kilian" commits, and the current branch-specific view doesn't contain any "kilian" commits, I need to persist with this navigation. Let me try the click action again with a longer wait time after the click to allow for page loading.

```click("302")```
```noop(2000)```

Looking at the current situation, I can see that my previous attempts to navigate to the repository-wide commits view have timed out. The current page is still showing the branch-specific commits for "add-color-utility-classes" with no "kilian" commits found.

Since the navigation clicks are timing out, I should try a different approach. I notice in the URL that we're currently on a branch-specific commits page:
`http://172.26.116.102:8080/a11yproject/a11yproject.com/-/commits/add-color-utility-classes`

To get to the repository-wide commits view, I can modify the URL directly by removing the branch name from the path. The repository-wide commits URL should be:
`http://172.26.116.102:8080/a11yproject/a11yproject.com/-/commits`

This approach bypasses the navigation issues and should take me directly to the repository-wide commits view where I can search for "kilian" commits.

```goto("http://172.26.116.102:8080/a11yproject/a11yproject.com/-/commits")```

Looking at the current situation, I can see that both navigation clicks and direct URL navigation are timing out. This suggests there might be network connectivity issues or the server is responding slowly. 

However, I notice that the current page is still showing commits from 2020, which is much earlier than the target date of March 5, 2023. Since "kilian" doesn't appear in the current branch's commit history and navigation to the repository-wide view is failing, I should try a different search approach.

I can see there's an "Author" filter button (bid 586) on the current page. This might allow me to filter commits by author directly without needing to navigate away. Let me try using this filter to search for "kilian" commits.

```click("586")```

2025-11-20 18:21:31,479 - 80190 - browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - action:
Looking at the current situation, I can see that:

1. My previous attempts to navigate to the repository-wide commits view have failed due to timeouts
2. The current branch "add-color-utility-classes" only contains commits from 2020, which is before the target date of March 5, 2023
3. Searching for "author:kilian" in the current branch returned no results
4. The "Author" filter dropdown is currently expanded (expanded=True) and focused

Since the Author filter is already open and focused, I should use this to search for "kilian" directly. I can see there's a search box (bid 598) within the Author dropdown menu where I can type "kilian" to filter the author list.

```fill("598", "kilian")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that:

1. The Author filter dropdown is open and focused
2. There's already a search box (bid 598) within the dropdown with the value "kilian" pre-filled
3. The search box is focused

Since "kilian" is already entered in the search box and the field is focused, I should press Enter to execute the search and filter commits by this author. This should show me all commits by "kilian" in the current branch, after which I can look for commits from March 5, 2023.

```keyboard_press("Enter")```
