Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. I need to find the "a11y-webring.club" project and then navigate to its commit history to check Steven Woodson's commits on 2/6/2023.

I can see the "a11y-webring.club" project in the list with the heading "Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club". I need to click on this project link to access its repository page where I can then navigate to the commit history.

```click("647")```

Looking at the current page, I can see we're now on the a11y-webring.club project page. I can see there's a "History" link (bid 777) in the navigation area, which should take me to the commit history where I can filter by date and author to find Steven Woodson's commits on 2/6/2023.

```click("777")```

Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the commit history page for the "fix-forced-colors-mode" branch. I need to find Steven Woodson's commits on 2/6/2023. From the accessibility tree, I can see commit listings grouped by date, but I don't see any commits from February 6th, 2023 in the visible content. The dates shown are February 4th, 2nd, 31st January, 30th, 28th, and 27th. 

Since the goal is to find commits specifically from 2/6/2023, I should first check if there's a way to filter or search for commits by date. I can see there's a search box (bid 648) labeled "Search by message" and an "Author" filter button (bid 605). I should use the date filter functionality to narrow down to the specific date.

```click("605")```

Looking at the current page, I can see the Author filter menu is open (expanded=True). However, I need to filter by date rather than author to find commits from 2/6/2023. The current commit list shows dates like "04 Feb, 2023" and "02 Feb, 2023" but no February 6th commits are visible. 

Since there's no direct date filter visible in the current interface, I should scroll down to see if there are more commits from later dates that aren't currently visible in the viewport. The commit history might extend beyond what's currently shown.

```scroll(0, 500)```

Looking at the current page state, I can see we're on the commit history page for the "fix-forced-colors-mode" branch. I've already scrolled down, but from the accessibility tree, I can see all the commit dates that are currently loaded: February 4th, 2nd, 31st January, 30th, 28th, and 27th. There are no February 6th commits visible in the current data.

Since the goal is specifically to find Steven Woodson's commits on 2/6/2023, and this date isn't present in the current commit list, I should check if we're on the correct branch. The current branch is "fix-forced-colors-mode" but Steven Woodson's commits might be on a different branch or in the main branch. I should navigate to the main branch's commit history.

From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a button labeled "fix-forced-colors-mode" (bid 583) which likely opens a branch selector. I should click this to switch to the main branch.

```click("583")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that after clicking the branch selector (bid 583), a dropdown menu has opened with various branch options including "main" (bid 1496). Since I need to check Steven Woodson's commits on 2/6/2023 and they weren't visible in the "fix-forced-colors-mode" branch, I should switch to the main branch to see if those commits exist there.

```click("1496")```

Looking at the error message, I can see that the click on the "main" branch link (bid 1496) failed because another element (a time element with bid 690) was intercepting pointer events. This suggests there might be an overlay or popup blocking the interaction.

Since the branch selector dropdown is open and I need to switch to the main branch, I should try a different approach. Let me first close any potential overlays by pressing Escape, then try clicking the main branch link again.

```keyboard_press("Escape")```

Looking at the current situation, I can see that my attempt to click the "main" branch was blocked by an overlay. After pressing Escape to close any potential overlays, I should now try clicking the branch selector again to reopen it and then select the main branch.

The branch selector button (bid 583) is still visible in the accessibility tree, so I'll click it to reopen the branch dropdown menu.

```click("583")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that after pressing Escape and then clicking the branch selector again, the dropdown should now be open. I need to select the "main" branch to view its commit history, as Steven Woodson's commits from 2/6/2023 might not be in the current "fix-forced-colors-mode" branch.

From the accessibility tree, I can see the "main" branch link has bid 1496. I should click it to switch to the main branch's commit history.

```click("1496")```

Looking at the error message, I can see that the click on the "main" branch link (bid 1496) is being blocked by a time element (bid 690) that's intercepting pointer events. This suggests there's some overlay or tooltip that's preventing the click.

Since I need to switch to the main branch to check for Steven Woodson's commits on 2/6/2023, and the direct click approach isn't working due to the overlay, I should try a different strategy. Let me first scroll the page to potentially move the interfering element out of the way, then try clicking the main branch link again.

```scroll(0, -300)```
