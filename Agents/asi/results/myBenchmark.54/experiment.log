Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing projects. I need to find and navigate to the "a11yproject/a11yproject.com" project first, then locate the merge request related to focus edge cases and post a "close because non reproducible" comment.

The page shows a search box at the top (bid 156) that can be used to search for projects. I'll use this to search for the a11yproject repository.

```search_project('156', 'a11yproject/a11yproject.com')```

Looking at the current state, I can see the search has already been executed and shows "We couldn't find any projects matching a11yproject/a11yproject.com". This suggests the project might not exist or I need to navigate differently. Since the search didn't find the project, I should try navigating to the merge requests section directly to see if I can find the merge request there, as the navigation shows there is 1 merge request available.

```click('159')```

Looking at the current state, I can see that clicking the "Merge requests" link (bid 159) has expanded a dropdown menu showing options like "Assigned to you 1" and "Review requests for you 0". Since there's 1 merge request assigned to me, I should click on "Assigned to you 1" to view the merge request that I need to comment on.

Looking at the current state, I can see I'm now viewing the merge request titled "Fix 'Introduction' link at the Foundations page (#311)" which is assigned to me. However, this doesn't appear to be the merge request about "focus edge cases" that I need to comment on. Since this is the only merge request showing in my assigned list, I should search for the specific merge request about focus edge cases.

I can see there's a search box (bid 357) in the recent searches section that I can use to search for merge requests. I'll search for "focus edge cases" to find the relevant merge request.

```fill('357', 'focus edge cases')```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I've filled the search box with "focus edge cases" but haven't executed the search yet. The search box (bid 357) is already focused and has the text entered, but I need to press Enter to actually perform the search and find the merge request about focus edge cases.

```keyboard_press('Enter')```

Looking at the current state, I can see that after searching for "focus edge cases", the page shows "Sorry, your filter produced no results" with the message "To widen your search, change or remove filters above". This means the search didn't find any merge requests matching "focus edge cases" in my current view.

Since the goal is to post a comment on a merge request about focus edge cases in the a11yproject/a11yproject.com project, I need to first navigate to that specific project. The search for the project name earlier didn't work, so I should try a different approach. I notice there's a "Projects" button in the top navigation that I can use to browse projects.

```click('67')```

Looking at the current situation, I can see that my previous attempts to find the merge request have failed because I haven't successfully navigated to the a11yproject/a11yproject.com project first. The search for the project didn't find it, and searching for the merge request directly from the dashboard didn't work either.

I notice that when I clicked the "Projects" button (bid 67), it expanded a dropdown menu. In the accessibility tree, I can see there are options like "Your projects", "Starred projects", "Explore projects", etc. Since I need to find a specific project, I should click on "Your projects" to see all projects I have access to, which might include the a11yproject/a11yproject.com project.

Looking at the current situation, I've been trying to find the a11yproject/a11yproject.com project but haven't been successful. I'm now on the "Your projects" page which shows a list of all my projects. I can see various projects in the list but none appear to be "a11yproject/a11yproject.com".

Since the project isn't showing up in my projects list and the search didn't find it, it's possible that:
1. The project doesn't exist in this GitLab instance
2. I don't have access to the project
3. The project name might be different

Given that I can't find the project, I should report this as infeasible since I cannot proceed to find and comment on the merge request without access to the project.

```report_infeasible("I cannot find the a11yproject/a11yproject.com project in this GitLab instance. The project may not exist, I may not have access to it, or the project name might be different. Without access to the project, I cannot locate the merge request about focus edge cases to post the requested comment.")```
