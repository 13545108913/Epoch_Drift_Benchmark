Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. I need to find the "gimmiethat.space" repository to invite collaborators. I don't see "gimmiethat.space" in the currently visible project list, so I should search for it using the search functionality.

I can see there's a search box with the description "Search or jump to…" which has bid 156. I'll use this to search for the "gimmiethat.space" repository.

```search_repositories('156', 'gimmiethat.space')```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on a search results page for "gimmiethat.space". The search has been executed and I can see one project result: "Byte Blaze / Hello" which appears to be the project I'm looking for. The project link has the text "Byte Blaze / Hello" and appears to be clickable. I should click on this project link to navigate to the repository page where I can then access the member settings to invite collaborators.

```click('338')```

Looking at the error message, it seems the click action timed out even though the element was found and appeared to be clickable. The element with bid '338' was located but the click didn't complete within the timeout period. 

Let me check the current page state again. I can see from the accessibility tree that I'm on the "Byte Blaze / Hello" project page, which appears to be the gimmiethat.space repository based on the URL and project name. Since I'm already on the correct repository page, I don't need to click on the search result link anymore.

Now I need to navigate to the member settings to invite collaborators. Looking at the sidebar navigation, I can see there's a "Members" link with bid '500' under the project navigation section. This is where I can manage project members and invite collaborators.

```click('500')```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the "Members" page for the gimmiethat.space repository (as indicated by the URL and page title). Both Jakub Klinkovský (@lahwaacz) and Benoît Blanchon (@bblanchon) are already listed as members with "Developer" roles. 

Since the goal is to invite them as collaborators but they're already members, I should notify the user that both users are already collaborators on this repository with Developer access.

```send_msg_to_user("Both Jakub Klinkovský (@lahwaacz) and Benoît Blanchon (@bblanchon) are already collaborators on the gimmiethat.space repository with Developer roles. No action needed.")```
