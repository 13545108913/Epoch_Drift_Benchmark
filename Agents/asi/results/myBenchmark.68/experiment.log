Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing projects. The goal is to review a merge request on a "404 link" (likely referring to a specific merge request). I can see there's a "Merge requests" link in the navigation with a badge showing "1", indicating there's one merge request pending.

I should first navigate to the merge requests page to see the available merge requests.

```click("182")```

Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see that clicking the "Merge requests" link (bid 182) has expanded a dropdown menu showing options like "Assigned to you 1" and "Review requests for you 0". Since I need to review a merge request, I should click on the "Assigned to you 1" link to see the merge request that's assigned to me.

```click("190")```

Looking at the current state, I can see I'm on the Merge Requests dashboard page showing one open merge request titled "Fix 'Introduction' link at the Foundations page (#311)". This appears to be the merge request I need to review. The goal is to check if the author (Byte Blaze) responded at the end and either thank them or remind them.

I need to open this specific merge request to see the discussion and comments. I can see the merge request title is a clickable link (bid 587).

```click("587")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the specific merge request page for "Fix 'Introduction' link at the Foundations page (#311)". The goal is to check if the author (Byte Blaze) responded at the end of the discussion. 

From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a comments section with a textbox for writing comments (bid 869), but I need to scroll down to see the actual discussion thread and comments that have been posted. The current view shows the merge request details but not the full conversation history.

I should scroll down to see the discussion thread and check for recent responses from the author.

```scroll(0, 500)```

Looking at the current state, I've scrolled down but still don't see the actual discussion thread with comments in the accessibility tree. The tree shows the comment input area (textbox with bid 869) but doesn't display existing comments. This suggests I need to scroll further down to load and view the conversation history where I can check if the author (Byte Blaze) has responded recently.

I should continue scrolling down to reveal more of the page content, particularly the discussion thread below the comment input area.

```scroll(0, 800)```

Looking at the current state, I've scrolled down but the accessibility tree still doesn't show the actual discussion thread with comments. The tree only displays the comment input interface (textbox bid 869) and various buttons, but no existing comments are visible. This could mean:

1. The comments are further down and need more scrolling
2. The comments section is collapsed or needs to be expanded
3. There might be no comments yet on this merge request

Since the goal is to check if the author responded at the end, I need to find the actual discussion thread. Let me try scrolling further down to see if I can reveal the comments section.

```scroll(0, 1200)```

Looking at the current state, I've scrolled down significantly (1200 pixels) but the accessibility tree still doesn't show any existing comments or discussion thread. The tree only shows the comment input interface and various action buttons, but no actual posted comments are visible. This suggests that either:

1. There are no comments on this merge request yet
2. The comments are loaded in a different section that isn't being captured in the current accessibility tree view
3. I need to interact with the page differently to load the comments

Since the goal is to check if the author (Byte Blaze) responded at the end, and I can't see any comments in the accessibility tree, it's likely there are no comments yet. However, let me try one more approach - I'll look for any indicators of activity or participants in the sidebar information.

From the accessibility tree, I can see in the complementary section (bid 935) there's information showing "1 participant" and Byte Blaze is listed as the assignee. This suggests there might be some activity, but without visible comments, I cannot determine if the author has responded.

Given that I cannot see the actual discussion thread despite extensive scrolling, I should report that the current view doesn't allow me to check for author responses.

```report_infeasible("I cannot see the discussion thread or comments section in the current page view to check if the author has responded. The comments may be loaded in a different way that isn't accessible through the current interface.")```
