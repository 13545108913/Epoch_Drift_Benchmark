The agent attempted to navigate and scroll but reported it was infeasible to see any comments or discussion thread. The final state indicates no comments are visible, and the agent did not provide a response to the user regarding whether the author responded or not. Since the agent failed to determine the presence of an author response and did not complete the information-seeking part of the task (nor did it reply to the user as required), the execution is unsuccessful.", "uid": 68}]
