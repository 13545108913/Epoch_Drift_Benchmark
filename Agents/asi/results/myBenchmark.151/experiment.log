Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on a GitLab repository page showing files in the "github/fork/chtitux/addRssFeed" branch. To find the contributor with the most commits to the "php52" branch, I need to navigate to the repository's contributors page, which shows commit statistics by contributor.

From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a navigation sidebar with a "Repository" section that contains a "Contributors" link. The "Contributors" link has bid "332" according to the tree.

Let me click on the Contributors link to navigate to the contributors statistics page.

```click("332")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on a contributors page, but it's showing statistics for the "github/fork/chtitux/addRssFeed" branch. The goal is to find the contributor with the most commits to the "php52" branch, so I need to switch to that branch first.

I can see there's a button at the top showing the current branch name "github/fork/chtitux/addRssFeed" with bid "499". I should click this to change the branch.

```click("499")```

Looking at the current page, I can see that after clicking the branch dropdown, a list of branches appeared including "php52" (bid "769"). I need to select the php52 branch to view the contributors for that specific branch.

```click("769")```

Looking at the error message, I can see that the click on the php52 branch link (bid "769") failed because there's an overlay element (bid "517") intercepting the click. This appears to be the branch dropdown menu that's still open and blocking interaction.

I need to first close the branch dropdown menu before I can interact with the page. Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see there's a "Close" button with bid "506" in the branch dropdown section. Let me click that to close the dropdown.

```click("506")```

Looking at the error, I can see that the branch dropdown menu (bid "517") is still open and intercepting clicks, preventing me from closing it. The "Close" button (bid "506") is inside this dropdown, but clicking it is being blocked by the dropdown overlay itself.

I need a different approach. Since the dropdown is open and blocking interaction, I should try to press the Escape key to close the dropdown menu instead of trying to click the close button.

```keyboard_press("Escape")```

Looking at the current situation, I can see that the branch dropdown menu is still open and blocking interactions. My previous attempt to press Escape should have closed it, but let me verify the current state and try a different approach if needed.

From the accessibility tree, I can see that the current page is still showing contributors for the "github/fork/chtitux/addRssFeed" branch. The branch dropdown button (bid "499") is still visible and focused. Since pressing Escape didn't work as expected, let me try clicking directly on the branch dropdown button again to close it, as clicking an already-open dropdown often closes it.

```click("499")```

Looking at the current situation, I can see that the branch dropdown menu is still open and blocking interactions. My previous attempts to close it by clicking the close button or pressing Escape haven't worked. 

Let me try a different approach - I'll click on the main content area of the page (outside the dropdown) to dismiss the dropdown menu. From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a main content area with bid "491". Clicking outside the dropdown should close it.

```click("491")```

Looking at the current situation, I can see that the branch dropdown menu is still open and blocking interactions. My previous attempts to close it haven't been successful. 

Let me try a different approach - I'll scroll the page slightly to potentially disrupt the dropdown overlay, then try clicking outside the dropdown again. Scrolling might help dismiss the dropdown menu.

```scroll(0, 100)```

Looking at the current situation, I can see that the branch dropdown menu is persistently open and blocking interactions. My previous attempts to close it through various methods (clicking close button, pressing Escape, clicking outside, scrolling) have all failed. 

Since I cannot interact with the page while this dropdown is open, and I've exhausted the typical methods for closing dropdowns, I should try a more direct approach. Let me attempt to navigate directly to the contributors page for the php52 branch by modifying the URL. The current URL shows we're on the contributors page for the "github/fork/chtitux/addRssFeed" branch. I can try to navigate directly to the php52 branch contributors by constructing the appropriate URL.

```goto("http://172.26.116.102:8080/amwhalen/archive-my-tweets/-/graphs/github%2Ffork%2Fchtitux%2FaddRssFeed?ref=php52")```

Looking at the current situation, I can see that my previous attempts to close the branch dropdown menu have all failed, preventing me from switching to the php52 branch. However, I notice that the current URL already shows we're viewing contributors for a specific branch, and the URL contains a "ref" parameter that specifies the branch.

The current URL is: `http://172.26.116.102:8080/amwhalen/archive-my-tweets/-/graphs/github%2Ffork%2Fchtitux%2FaddRssFeed?ref=php52`

Wait, I can see that the URL already has `?ref=php52` at the end, which means we're already viewing the php52 branch! Let me verify this by looking at the contributors list on the current page.

From the accessibility tree, I can see the contributors are listed with their commit counts:
- Andrew Whalen: 30 commits
- amwhalen: 8 commits  
- ProgVal: 7 commits
- andrew.whalen: 7 commits
- andrew.whalen@gmail.com: 6 commits
- Théophile Helleboid - chtitux: 4 commits
- and others with fewer commits

Andrew Whalen has the most commits (30) to the php52 branch. Now I need to get their full name, GitLab account name, location, and email address. The current page shows:
- Full name: Andrew Whalen (from heading "Andrew Whalen")
- Email: github@amwhalen.com (from paragraph "30 commits (github@amwhalen.com)")

However, I need to find their GitLab account name and location. Let me click on Andrew Whalen's name to view their profile, which should contain this information.

```click("540")```
