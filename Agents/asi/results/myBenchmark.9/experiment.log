Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. I need to find the "a11yproject" repository and then navigate to its commit history to count Kilian's commits on 3/1/2023.

First, I should search for the "a11yproject" repository using the search functionality. I can see there's a search box with the bid '156' in the accessibility tree.

```search_project('156', 'a11yproject')```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the search results page for "a11yproject" with one project result showing: "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com". Since the search has already been executed and the project is visible, I should click on this project link to navigate to its main page, where I can then access the repository and commit history.

The project link has the bid '341' according to the accessibility tree.

```click('341')```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the a11yproject.com repository page. I need to find Kilian's commits from March 1, 2023. I can see there's a "History" link in the navigation (bid '778') which should take me to the commit history where I can filter or search for specific commits by date and author.

```click('778')```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the commit history page for the "add-color-utility-classes" branch of the a11yproject repository. The commits shown are from 2020, which is much earlier than the target date of March 1, 2023. 

To find Kilian's commits from 3/1/2023, I need to either:
1. Switch to the main/default branch where recent commits would be
2. Use the author filter to search for Kilian's commits
3. Navigate to a more general commit history page

I can see there's an "Author" filter button (bid '605') that I can use to filter commits by Kilian. This would be the most direct approach to find Kilian's commits, and then I can look for those from March 1, 2023.

```click('605')```

Looking at the current state, I can see that after clicking the "Author" filter button, a dropdown menu has appeared with various author options. I need to find Kilian in this list to filter commits by them. Scanning through the menu items, I can see authors like "Abishek S", "Byte Blaze", "Roshan Jossy", "The A11Y Project", and "Vinta Chen", but I don't see "Kilian" listed.

Since Kilian isn't visible in the current author list, I should search for them using the search box within the author filter menu. I can see there's a textbox with bid '617' labeled "Search" where I can type "Kilian" to find if they exist as an author.

```fill('617', 'Kilian')```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I've already filled "Kilian" into the author search box (bid '617'). The search should have filtered the author list, but I don't see any results for Kilian in the current accessibility tree. This suggests that either:

1. Kilian doesn't have any commits to this repository
2. Kilian's commits are on a different branch
3. I need to press Enter to execute the search

Since I've filled the search box but haven't executed the search yet, I should press Enter to trigger the search and see if Kilian appears in the filtered results.

```keyboard_press('Enter')```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I've searched for "Kilian" in the author filter but haven't found any results. The commits currently displayed are all from 2020, which is much earlier than the target date of March 1, 2023. 

Since I'm currently viewing the "add-color-utility-classes" branch, I should navigate to the main/default branch where more recent commits would be located. I can see there's a branch selector button (bid '583') that shows "add-color-utility-classes" - clicking this should allow me to switch to a different branch like "main" where I might find 2023 commits.

```click('583')```

Looking at the current state, I can see that after clicking the branch selector (bid '583'), a dropdown menu has appeared showing various branches including "main" (bid '1631'). Since I'm currently on the "add-color-utility-classes" branch which only has commits from 2020, I need to switch to the "main" branch to see more recent commits, including potentially those from 2023 where I might find Kilian's commits from March 1, 2023.

```click('1631')```

Looking at the error message, I can see that the click on the "main" branch link (bid '1631') is failing because other elements are intercepting pointer events - specifically commit links from the current page content are overlapping with the branch dropdown menu. 

The branch dropdown is likely being obscured by the commit list content. I need to either:
1. Close the branch dropdown first and try a different approach
2. Use a different method to navigate to the main branch

Since the branch dropdown is currently open and interfering with navigation, I should first close it by clicking the "Close" button (bid '590') that appears in the branch selector dropdown, then try a different approach to access the main branch commits.

```click('590')```

Looking at the current situation, I can see that the branch dropdown is open but I'm unable to close it because commit list elements are intercepting pointer events. The commits shown are all from 2020, which is much earlier than the target date of March 1, 2023.

Since I'm stuck on this specific branch ("add-color-utility-classes") and can't easily navigate to the main branch due to the UI interference, I should take a different approach. I can navigate directly to the main repository's commit history page by modifying the URL or using the repository navigation.

Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see there's a "Repository" section in the sidebar (bid '308') that contains a "Commits" link (bid '321'). This should take me to the main repository's commit history rather than being stuck on this specific branch.

```click('321')```
