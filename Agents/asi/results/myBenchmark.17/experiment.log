Looking at the current page, I can see a list of projects with their star counts. The goal is to find repositories where I made contributions that have 0 stars. From the accessibility tree, I can see several projects with "0" stars (indicated by links with "0" text and star icons).

Let me scan through the projects to identify those with 0 stars where I have a contributor role (Maintainer, Owner, or Developer):

- Byte Blaze / dotfiles: 0 stars, Maintainer
- x-lab / 2019-nCov: 0 stars, Owner  
- n-lab / 2019-nCov: 0 stars, Owner
- webagent / 2019-nCov: 0 stars, Owner
- Byte Blaze / PyTorch-GAN: 0 stars, Maintainer
- coding_friends / PyTorch-GAN: 1 star, Owner (not 0)
- crew / PyTorch-GAN: 0 stars, Owner
- x-lab / PyTorch-GAN: 0 stars, Owner
- coding_friends / 2019-nCov: 1 star, Owner (not 0)
- n-lab / PyTorch-GAN: 0 stars, Owner
- crew / 2019-nCov: 0 stars, Owner
- x-lab / 2019-nCov: 0 stars, Owner
- n-lab / 2019-nCov: 0 stars, Owner

I'll compile the list of repositories where I contributed and have 0 stars.

```send_msg_to_user("Based on the current projects view, here are the repositories where you made contributions and they have 0 stars:\n\n- Byte Blaze / dotfiles (Maintainer)\n- x-lab / 2019-nCov (Owner)\n- n-lab / 2019-nCov (Owner)\n- webagent / 2019-nCov (Owner)\n- Byte Blaze / PyTorch-GAN (Maintainer)\n- crew / PyTorch-GAN (Owner)\n- x-lab / PyTorch-GAN (Owner)\n- n-lab / PyTorch-GAN (Owner)\n- crew / 2019-nCov (Owner)\n- x-lab / 2019-nCov (Owner)\n- n-lab / 2019-nCov (Owner)")```
