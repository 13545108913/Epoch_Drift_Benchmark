Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing projects. I need to find the "a11yproject.com" repository first, then navigate to create a merge request from the "redesign" branch to the "markdown-figure-block" branch, and assign myself as reviewer.

From the project list, I can see several repositories but I don't see "a11yproject.com" in the visible list. I should search for it first.

I can see there's a search box with ID '156' in the navigation bar that says "Search or jump to…". This would be the appropriate place to search for the repository.

```search_repository('156', 'a11yproject.com')```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on a search results page for "a11yproject.com" and there's a visible project result for "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com". The search has already been performed, so I don't need to search again. I should click on this project link to navigate to the repository page where I can create the merge request.

The project link appears to be element with bid '338' based on the accessibility tree showing "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" as a link.

```click("338")```

This is where I need to go to create the merge request.

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the Merge Requests page for the a11yproject.com repository. The page shows there are currently 0 merge requests and has a "New merge request" link with bid '586'.

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the "New merge request" page. The accessibility tree shows the form is already loaded with source and target branch selection fields. I need to:

1. Select "redesign" as the source branch
2. Select "markdown-figure-block" as the target branch
3. Continue to the next step where I can assign myself as reviewer

I can see there's a "Select source branch" button with bid '616' and a target branch dropdown showing "add-color-utility-classes" with bid '660'. I should first click the source branch selector to choose the "redesign" branch.
