Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on a GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. The user wants to see the command to clone ChatGPT with SSH. Since this is a GitLab instance, I need to first find the ChatGPT repository in this GitLab instance, then navigate to its page where the SSH clone command would be displayed.

Let me search for "ChatGPT" in the GitLab search bar to find the relevant repository.

```click("156")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on a GitLab dashboard with a search box (bid 156) already focused. The user wants to find the SSH clone command for a ChatGPT repository. I need to search for "ChatGPT" in this GitLab instance to locate the repository, then navigate to its page where the clone commands are typically displayed.

Since the search box is already focused, I can directly type "ChatGPT" to search for it.

```fill("156", "ChatGPT")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the "Byte Blaze / chatgpt_plugin" project page in GitLab. The user wants to see the SSH clone command for this repository. On GitLab project pages, the clone command is typically found in the "Clone" section, which appears to be available based on the accessibility tree showing a "Clone" link (bid 646). I should click on this "Clone" link to reveal the clone options, including the SSH clone command.

Looking at the current page state, I can see that the "Clone" link (bid 646) has already been clicked and is now expanded (expanded=True). The accessibility tree shows the clone options are visible, including "Clone with SSH" with the repository URL displayed as "git@localhost:byteblaze/chatgpt_plugin.git" in a textbox (bid 653). 

Since the SSH clone command is now visible, I can simply send this information to the user. The command to clone this repository using SSH is: `git clone git@localhost:byteblaze/chatgpt_plugin.git`

```send_msg_to_user("The SSH command to clone the ChatGPT repository is: git clone git@localhost:byteblaze/chatgpt_plugin.git")```
