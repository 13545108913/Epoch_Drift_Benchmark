Looking at the current page, I can see the GitLab dashboard with a list of projects. I need to find the "byteblaze/dotfiles" project and navigate to it to change its license to MIT. I can see "Byte Blaze / dotfiles" listed in the project list.

The project "Byte Blaze / dotfiles" appears to have the bid "449" based on the accessibility tree structure. I should click on this link to navigate to the project page where I can access and modify the license file.

```click("449")```

Looking at the current page state, I can see that I'm already on the "Byte Blaze / dotfiles" project page. The accessibility tree shows we're viewing the repository files, and I can see there's already a "LICENSE" file listed in the table (row with bid 1177-1185). 

Since the goal is to make the LICENSE file use the MIT license, I need to click on the existing LICENSE file to view and edit it. The LICENSE file appears to have been added 3 days ago according to the timestamp.

```click("1178")```

Looking at the current page, I can see that I'm already on the LICENSE file view page. The accessibility tree shows the content of the LICENSE file, which appears to already be the MIT License based on the text displayed. The page states "This project is licensed under the MIT License" and shows the full MIT license text.

However, the goal is to "make the LICENSE of byteblaze/dotfiles to MIT license," which suggests the current license might not be MIT or needs to be confirmed as MIT. Since the page already shows MIT license content, I should verify if this is indeed the current state and send this information to the user.

```send_msg_to_user("The LICENSE file for byteblaze/dotfiles already contains the MIT License text. The project appears to already be using the MIT license.")```
