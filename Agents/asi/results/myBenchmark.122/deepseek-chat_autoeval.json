[{"idx": 122, "gt": 0.0, "rm": false, "thoughts": "The user's intent is to create an issue in the empathy-prompts repo with specific details: title \"Integrating LLMs for better prompts\", assign to Roshanjossey, and set due date to the beginning of Q2 2033. This is a content modification task. The action history shows the agent filled the title, assigned to Roshanjossey, and interacted with the date selection by opening the year dropdown and clicking on 2033. However, the final state only describes the dropdown being open with 2033 selected, but does not confirm the issue was successfully created or that the due date was fully set (e.g., selecting the quarter or finalizing the date). Without evidence of completion (like a confirmation or the issue being listed), and given the bot provided no response, the task appears incomplete.", "uid": 122}]
