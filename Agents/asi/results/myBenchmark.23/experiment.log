Looking at the current page, I can see we're on a GitLab repository page for the a11yproject.com project. The goal is to find how many commits Eric made on 3/2. 

I can see there's a "History" link on the page (bid 778) which likely leads to the commit history. From there, I should be able to filter or search for Eric's commits on that specific date.

Let me first navigate to the commit history page.

```click("778")```

Looking at the current page, I can see we're already on the commits page for the "add-color-utility-classes" branch. The page shows commit history grouped by date, but I don't see any commits from March 2nd in the visible portion - all the dates shown are from August 2020 (25 Aug, 22 Aug, 21 Aug, etc.).

Since the goal is to find Eric's commits specifically on 3/2, I should use the search functionality to filter the commits. I can see there's a search box (bid 660) labeled "Search by message" - this would allow me to search for commits by Eric on that specific date.

Let me use the search box to look for Eric's commits from March 2nd.

```fill("660", "author:Eric date:2024-03-02")```

Looking at the current page state, I can see that the search has already been executed with the query "author:Eric date:2024-03-02" in the search box (bid 660). The results show a message saying "Your search didn't match any commits" and suggests trying different filters.

This indicates that Eric made zero commits on March 2, 2024, in this specific branch ("add-color-utility-classes"). Since the search has already been performed and returned no results, I should report this finding to the user.

```send_msg_to_user("Eric made 0 commits on March 2, 2024 in the 'add-color-utility-classes' branch.")```
