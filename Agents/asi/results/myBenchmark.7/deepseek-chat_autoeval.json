The agent's action history shows it attempted to navigate and search for commits by Kilian, but the final state indicates an error where a click was blocked, and the agent was considering closing a dropdown menu. The bot provided no response to the user, meaning it did not deliver the requested information or state that the information was unavailable. Since the task requires the agent to respond with the information or an explicit unavailability statement, and it failed to do so, the execution is unsuccessful.", "uid": 7}]
