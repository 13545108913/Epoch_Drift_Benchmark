The action history shows that the agent successfully created the project (despite a timeout error on the final creation click, the final state confirms the project was created). However, the agent only clicked on the \"Members\" link (action 10) but did not perform any actions to actually add the specified members (Abishek and Vinta). Since the task requires both creating the project and adding the members, and the member addition was not completed, the execution is unsuccessful.", "uid": 139}]
