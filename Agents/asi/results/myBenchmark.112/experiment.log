Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. I need to navigate to the specific repository "a11y-webring.club" to add users as developers. I can see this repository in the project list with the heading "Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club" and link ID '847'.

The best next action is to click on this repository link to navigate to its page, where I can then access the member management settings to add users.

```click("847")```

Looking at the current page, I can see we're now on the repository page for "a11y-webring.club". To add users as developers, I need to navigate to the member management settings. From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a "Members" link in the project navigation sidebar with ID '500'. This is the correct place to manage project members.

```click("500")```

Looking at the current page, I can see we're already on the Members page for the a11y-webring.club repository. The page shows the "Invite member" tab is active, and I can see the form elements needed to add new members. 

I need to add two users as developers: 'abisubramanya27' and 'lahwaacz'. I can see from the existing members table that 'abisubramanya27' and 'lahwaacz' are already members with Developer role, so they don't need to be added again. The goal is already accomplished - both users are already developers in this repository.

Since the requested users are already members with the correct role, I should inform the user that this task is already complete.

```send_msg_to_user("Both users 'abisubramanya27' and 'lahwaacz' are already members of the a11y-webring.club repository with Developer role, as shown in the current members list. No action needed.")```
