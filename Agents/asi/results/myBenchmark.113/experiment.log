Looking at the current page, I can see this is a GitLab dashboard showing projects, but the goal is to add users to a GitHub timeline item management extension as maintainers. The current page is GitLab, not GitHub, so I need to navigate to GitHub first.

Since there are no GitHub tabs currently open, I should open a new tab and navigate to GitHub.com to begin the process of adding maintainers to the GitHub extension.

```new_tab()
goto('https://github.com')
```
