Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing projects. To follow the specified users, I need to navigate to the search functionality to find these users and then follow them. The search box appears to be available in the top navigation bar.

Let me use the search functionality to find the first user 'Jakub Klinkovsk' and then navigate to their profile to follow them.

```click("156")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing projects. I previously clicked on the search box (bid 156) to initiate a search. Now I need to search for the first user 'Jakub Klinkovsk' to find their profile.

```fill("156", "Jakub Klinkovsk")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I've already clicked on the search box (bid 156) and filled it with "Jakub Klinkovsk". The accessibility tree shows that the search box has the value 'Jakub Klinkovsk' and there's already a search result displayed below it - a link for '"Jakub Klinkovsk" in all GitLab'. I should click on this search result to navigate to Jakub Klinkovsk's profile page where I can follow them.

Looking at the current state, I can see that I'm on a search results page for "Jakub Klinkovsk" but the search didn't find any projects matching this query. The accessibility tree shows a heading that says "We couldn't find any projects matching Jakub Klinkovsk". However, I notice there's a "Users" link in the search results categories that I should click to search specifically for users rather than projects.

```click("322")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I'm on the search results page for "Jakub Klinkovsk" and there's already a user result displayed. The accessibility tree shows a list item with a link to "Jakub Klinkovský @lahwaacz" which appears to be the user I'm looking for. I should click on this user link to navigate to their profile page where I can follow them.

```click("333")```

Looking at the current state, I can see I'm now on Jakub Klinkovský's GitLab profile page (username @lahwaacz). The accessibility tree shows this is indeed the correct user profile with their name displayed and various profile information. 

I can see there's a "Follow" button/link available on the page (bid 275 shows "Unfollow" which suggests the current state is that I'm not following this user yet). To follow Jakub Klinkovský, I need to click on the follow button.

```click("275")```

Looking at the error message, I can see that the click action on bid 275 ("Unfollow") failed because there's an overlapping element (bid 276) that's intercepting pointer events. This suggests there might be a modal, tooltip, or some other UI element covering the follow button.

Since the button shows "Unfollow" but I want to follow the user, this indicates the current state is that I'm already following Jakub Klinkovský. However, the goal is to follow this user, and since they're already being followed, I should move on to the next user in the list.

Let me go back to the search functionality to find the next user "convexegg".

```click("156")```

Looking at the current situation, I can see that:

1. I successfully navigated to Jakub Klinkovský's profile (@lahwaacz)
2. The profile shows "Unfollow" which means this user is already being followed
3. Since the goal is to follow this user and they're already being followed, I should move on to the next user

The next user to follow is "convexegg". I need to use the search functionality again to find this user. The search box (bid 156) is still available in the navigation bar.

```click("156")```

Looking at the current situation, I can see that:

1. I'm still on Jakub Klinkovský's profile page
2. The search box (bid 156) is available in the top navigation
3. I need to search for the next user "convexegg"

Since I'm currently on a user profile page and need to search for another user, I should click on the search box to initiate a new search for "convexegg".

```fill("156", "convexegg")```
