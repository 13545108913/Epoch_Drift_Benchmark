The action history shows the agent successfully followed Jakub Klinkovsk\u00fd (as indicated by the \"Unfollow\" button in the final state) and began searching for \"convexegg\" by filling the search box. However, the action history stops after filling the search box for \"convexegg\" without completing the follow action for this or the remaining users (Vinta Chen, yjlou, Abishek S). Since the task requires following all specified users and the agent only completed one, the execution is incomplete and thus unsuccessful.", "uid": 107}]
