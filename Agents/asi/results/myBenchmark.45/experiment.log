Looking at the current page, I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. I need to find the "metaseq" repository to get contributor information. Since I don't see "metaseq" in the currently visible project list, I should search for it using the search functionality.

I can see there's a search box with bid "156" that has the label "Search or jump to…" - this is the global search bar I can use to find the metaseq repository.

```search_repository('156', 'metaseq')```

Looking at the current page, I can see that the search for "metaseq" has already been executed and there's a search result showing "Administrator / metaseq" project. The project link appears to have bid "341" based on the accessibility tree. I should click on this project link to navigate to the metaseq repository page where I can then find contributor statistics.

```click("341")```

Looking at the error message, it seems the click action on bid "341" timed out despite the element being found and appearing to be clickable. Since I'm already on the metaseq repository page (as evidenced by the current page showing "Administrator / metaseq" in the breadcrumbs and the repository files), I don't need to click on the search result again.

I can see from the current page that I'm on the metaseq repository main page. To find the top contributors by number of commits, I need to navigate to the contributors statistics page. Looking at the sidebar navigation, I can see there's an "Analytics" section with bid "419", and within that, I should be able to find contributor statistics.

Let me navigate to the Analytics section first, then find the contributors page.

```click("419")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the Value Stream Analytics page for the metaseq repository. This is not the right page to find contributor commit statistics. I need to navigate to the Repository Analytics section instead.

From the sidebar navigation, I can see there's an "Analytics" section (bid "419") that I already clicked, but I need to go deeper into the Repository analytics. Looking at the accessibility tree, under the Analytics section, there's a "Repository" link with bid "419" that I should click to access repository analytics including contributors.

```click("419")```

Looking at the current situation, I can see that I'm trying to navigate to the Repository Analytics page but the click action on bid "419" is timing out despite the element being found and appearing clickable. 

Let me examine the accessibility tree more carefully. I can see there's a "Repository" link under the Analytics section with bid "419", but I notice there's also a "Repository Analytics" breadcrumb link with bid "490" that might be more directly accessible. 

Since I'm already on some analytics page (Value Stream Analytics), I should try to navigate directly to the Repository Analytics where contributor statistics would be found. Let me try clicking the "Repository" link in the sidebar navigation again, but I'll use a different approach - I'll scroll to make sure it's fully in view first.

```scroll(0, 200)```
```click("419")```

Looking at the current page state and my past actions, I can see I'm stuck trying to navigate to the Repository Analytics page. The current page shows "Repository Analytics" in the breadcrumbs (bid "490"), which suggests I might already be on the correct page or very close to it.

From the accessibility tree, I can see the current page is titled "Repository Analytics" and shows commit statistics for the "Simplify-layers-of-inheritance" branch. However, I need contributor statistics, not just general commit statistics. 

Let me examine what's available on this page more carefully. I can see there are various statistics sections including "Commit statistics" but I don't see a direct contributors list. Since this is the Repository Analytics page, there should be a way to view contributor statistics. Let me try scrolling further down to see if there are more sections, or perhaps there's a different view I need to access.

```scroll(0, 400)```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the Repository Analytics page for the metaseq repository, specifically showing analytics for the "Simplify-layers-of-inheritance" branch. The page shows commit statistics but doesn't directly display the top contributors by number of commits.

From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a section showing "Total: 275 commits" and "Authors: 57", but I need the actual contributor names and their commit counts. The current view appears to be focused on branch-specific analytics rather than overall repository contributors.

I need to find a way to view the overall contributor statistics for the entire repository, not just a specific branch. Let me check if there are other navigation options or if I need to change the branch view to see overall statistics. I notice there's a branch selector button with bid "550" that currently shows "Simplify-layers-of-inheritance" - I should try changing this to view statistics for the entire repository or main branch.

```click("550")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the Repository Analytics page but viewing statistics for a specific branch ("Simplify-layers-of-inheritance"). The goal is to find the top 3 contributors by number of commits for the entire metaseq repository, not just a specific branch.

I can see there's a branch selector dropdown (bid "550") that's currently expanded, showing various branches. To get overall repository statistics, I should select the main branch or look for an option to view all branches/overall statistics. From the branch list, I can see "main" is available with bid "620". Selecting the main branch should give me the overall contributor statistics for the repository.

```click("620")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the Repository Analytics page for the main branch of the metaseq repository. The page shows commit statistics including "Total: 272 commits" and "Authors: 57", but I still don't see the actual list of contributors with their names and commit counts.

The current view shows various commit statistics charts but doesn't display the contributor ranking I need. In GitLab, contributor statistics with names and commit counts are typically found on a dedicated "Contributors" page, not just in the general repository analytics.

Let me look for a "Contributors" link or tab in the navigation. From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a "Repository" section in the sidebar navigation with various sub-options. I should navigate to the contributors page specifically.

```navigate_to_contributors()```

Looking at the error, the `navigate_to_contributors()` function failed because it couldn't find element with bid "302". This suggests the navigation structure might be different than expected. 

Let me examine the current accessibility tree more carefully. I can see I'm on the Repository Analytics page, and I notice there's a "Repository" link in the sidebar navigation with bid "302" that I should click to access repository-related analytics options, including contributors.

Let me try clicking the "Repository" link directly in the sidebar navigation:

```click("302")```
