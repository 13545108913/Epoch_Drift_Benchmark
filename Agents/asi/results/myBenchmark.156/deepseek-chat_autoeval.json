The action history shows that the agent filled in the group name and description, but only started adding the first member \"qhduan\" by filling the search box and identifying the user in the autocomplete menu. However, the agent did not complete the action to select \"qhduan\" from the dropdown (click(\"644\") is the last action, but the final state indicates the user is still in the autocomplete menu, not added), and there is no action to add the second member \"Agnes-U\". Since the group creation and member addition process is incomplete, the task is a failure.", "uid": 156}]
