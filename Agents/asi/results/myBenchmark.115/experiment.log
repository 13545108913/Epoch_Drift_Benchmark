Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing projects. The goal is to add user 'yjlou' as a guest to my time tracking tool. Based on the project list, I can see there's a project called "Byte Blaze / timeit" which appears to be the time tracking tool mentioned in the description as "Rails implementation of time tracking tool timeit".

To add a user as a guest, I need to:
1. Navigate to the timeit project
2. Go to the project settings/members section
3. Add the user with guest role

Let me start by clicking on the timeit project link.<｜end▁of▁thinking｜>I need to navigate to the time tracking tool project first. I can see "Byte Blaze / timeit" in the project list, which matches the description of being a time tracking tool. Let me click on that project link to access its settings where I can add users.

```click("352")```

Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see that after clicking the project link, I'm now on the timeit project page. I need to navigate to the Members section to add users. In the project navigation sidebar, I can see a "Members" link with bid "500". This is where I can manage project members and add new users.

```click("500")```

Looking at the current page state, I can see I'm now on the "Project members" page for the timeit project. The accessibility tree shows:

- A search box for "GitLab member or Email address" (bid "603")
- A role dropdown set to "Guest" (bid "611")
- An "Invite" button (bid "625") that is currently disabled

The user 'yjlou' is already listed in the members table with the role "Guest". Since the goal is to add 'yjlou' as a guest, and they're already present with that role, the task appears to be already completed. I should inform the user about this status.

```send_msg_to_user("User 'yjlou' is already added as a guest member to the timeit project. They appear in the members list with the Guest role.")```
