Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. I need to find the specific project "a11y-webring.club" which I can see in the project list. Once I'm in that project, I can navigate to its issues and find the specific issue about linking to an accessibility statement to assign it to Rohan.

I can see the "Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club" project in the list. I'll click on that project link to navigate to its project page.

```click("789")```

Looking at the current page, I can see we're now on the a11y-webring.club project page. I can see in the sidebar navigation that there's an "Issues" link with a count of "4" issues. To accomplish the goal of assigning an issue about linking to an accessibility statement to Rohan, I need to navigate to the issues page first.

I can see the Issues link in the project navigation sidebar with the bid "347".

```click("347")```

Looking at the current page, I can see we're now on the Issues page for the a11y-webring.club project. I can see a list of issues, and one of them is "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement" which appears to be issue #4. This matches the goal description. To assign this issue to Rohan, I first need to open the specific issue by clicking on its title link.

I can see the issue title link with the text "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement" in the accessibility tree.

```click("1085")```

Looking at the current page, I can see we're now on the specific issue page for "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement (#4)". The goal is to assign this issue to Rohan. I can see in the sidebar that there's a section showing "0 Assignees" with an "Edit" link next to it. This is where I can assign the issue to someone.

I need to click the "Edit" link next to "Assignees" to open the assignment interface.

```click("1014")```

Looking at the current page, I can see that after clicking the "Edit" link for assignees, the assignee selection interface has opened. I can see a search box that's focused (bid "1033") and a list of assignable users including "Rohan Kumar @Seirdy" (bid "1255"). To assign this issue to Rohan, I need to click on his name in the list of available assignees.

```click("1255")```

Looking at the error message, it appears that there's an overlay or element intercepting pointer events when trying to click on Rohan's name in the assignee list. The error indicates that elements with bids "1094", "1086", and "1085" are blocking the click action.

Since the assignee selection interface is open and the search box is focused, I should try a different approach. Instead of clicking directly on Rohan's name, I can use the search functionality to find and select him. I can see the search box is focused (bid "1033"), so I can type "Rohan" to filter the list and then select him.

Let me try searching for "Rohan" in the assignee search box and then pressing Enter to select the first matching result.

```fill("1033", "Rohan")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I've already filled "Rohan" into the search box (bid "1033"), and the search has filtered the list to show "Rohan Kumar @Seirdy" as the only result. The search box is still focused, and now I need to select Rohan from the filtered results. Since the search has already narrowed down to the correct user, I can press Enter to select the first (and only) matching result, which should assign Rohan to the issue.

```keyboard_press("Enter")```
