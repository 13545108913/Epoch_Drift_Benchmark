Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on a GitLab dashboard showing various projects. The goal is to create an issue in the "a11yproject" repo, but I don't see that specific repository listed in the current project view. I need to first navigate to the a11yproject repository before I can create an issue there.

I can see there's a search box available that I can use to find the a11yproject repository. The search box has bid '156' based on the accessibility tree.

```search_repositories('156', 'a11yproject')```
