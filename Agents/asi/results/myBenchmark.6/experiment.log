Looking at the current page, I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. My goal is to display issues in the "umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel" repository that have BUG-related labels. 

First, I need to find and navigate to the specific repository. I can see there's a search box available (bid 156) that I can use to search for the project. Let me search for "umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel" to find the repository.

```search_project('156', 'umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel')```

Looking at the current page, I can see that the search has already been performed for "umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel" but no projects were found. The page shows the message "We couldn't find any projects matching umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel". This suggests that either the repository doesn't exist in this GitLab instance or I need to use a different approach.

Since the search didn't yield results, I should try navigating to the Issues section directly to see if I can filter issues there. I can see there's an "Issues" link in the navigation (bid 155) that shows there are 17 issues. Let me click on that to access the issues dashboard where I might be able to filter by repository and labels.

```click("155")```

Looking at the current state, I can see I'm now on the Issues dashboard showing various issues from different repositories. My goal is to find issues specifically from the "umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel" repository with BUG-related labels. 

I can see there's a search box (bid 360) in the "Recent searches" section that I can use to search for issues. Let me search for the repository name "umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel" to filter issues from that specific repository.

```search_issues('360', 'umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel')```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the search for "umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel" has already been performed and the textbox (bid 360) shows this value. However, I'm still seeing issues from various repositories like a11yproject, byteblaze, primer, etc., but no issues from the umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel repository. This suggests that either:

1. The repository doesn't exist in this GitLab instance
2. There are no issues in that repository
3. I need to apply additional filters

Since the goal is to find BUG-related labels, I should first verify if the repository exists and has issues. Let me try clearing the current search and searching more broadly for "AndroidSlidingUpPanel" to see if the repository exists with a different naming convention.

```fill('360', 'AndroidSlidingUpPanel')```

Looking at the current situation, I've tried searching for both "umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel" and "AndroidSlidingUpPanel" but haven't found any issues from that repository. The current page shows issues from various other repositories but none from the target repository. This strongly suggests that either:

1. The umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel repository doesn't exist in this GitLab instance
2. The repository exists but has no issues
3. I don't have access to view issues from that repository

Since multiple search attempts have failed to find the repository or its issues, I should report this finding to the user rather than continuing to search unsuccessfully.

```send_msg_to_user("I've searched for the umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel repository but cannot find it in this GitLab instance. The repository either doesn't exist here, has no issues, or I don't have access to view its issues. You may need to verify the repository name or check if it exists in this GitLab installation.")```
