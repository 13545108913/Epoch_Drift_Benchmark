[{"idx": 111, "gt": 0.0, "rm": false, "thoughts": "The user's intent is to invite four collaborators (Jakub K, Alex Dills, Alex Hutnik, and Beno\u00eet Blanchon) to a time tracking tool project repo. This is a content modification task, so I need to examine the action history and final state to determine success. The action history shows the agent searched for the project, clicked to access it, and began adding collaborators. It successfully added Jakub K as a Developer, but then only started adding Alex Dills by filling the search field and seeing a dropdown with the correct user. However, the agent did not complete the action to select Alex Dills from the dropdown (bid '930'), and there is no record of attempting to add Alex Hutnik or Beno\u00eet Blanchon. The final state only confirms that the dropdown for Alex Dills appeared but was not selected. Since the task requires adding all four collaborators and the agent only partially completed one and did not address the others, the task is not successfully completed.", "uid": 111}]
