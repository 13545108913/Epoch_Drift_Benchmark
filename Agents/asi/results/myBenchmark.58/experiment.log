Looking at the current page, I can see this is a GitLab dashboard showing projects. I need to find and fork the PyTorch GAN repo with the most stars. From the accessibility tree, I can see several PyTorch-GAN repositories listed:

- Byte Blaze / PyTorch-GAN (0 stars)
- coding_friends / PyTorch-GAN (1 star)
- crew / PyTorch-GAN (1 star)
- x-lab / PyTorch-GAN (1 star)
- n-lab / PyTorch-GAN (1 star)

The repositories with 1 star appear to have the most stars. I should first search for "PyTorch-GAN" to see all repositories and identify which one has the highest star count.

I'll use the search functionality to find all PyTorch-GAN repositories.```search_project("156", "PyTorch-GAN")```
