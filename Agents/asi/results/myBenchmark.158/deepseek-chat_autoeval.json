The action history shows that the agent filled \"lukasoppermann\" and pressed Enter, then filled \"primer\" but did not press Enter or confirm the second assignment. The final state indicates that only \"lukasoppermann\" was successfully assigned, and the agent recognized the need to reopen the dropdown to add \"primer\" but did not complete the action. Since the task is a content modification and the final state does not show both assignees added, the execution is incomplete and unsuccessful.", "uid": 158}]
