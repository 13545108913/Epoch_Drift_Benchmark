Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing projects. I need to find the "aem-hacker" project to open an issue about the "OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use" error.

First, I should search for the "aem-hacker" project using the search functionality. I can see there's a search box available with bid '156' that says "Search or jump to…".

```search_project('156', 'aem-hacker')```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the "New Issue" page for the aem-hacker project. The form is already loaded with the title field focused (bid '513'), a description field (bid '585'), and a "Create issue" button (bid '629') that is currently disabled. 

To create the issue about the "OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use" error, I need to:
1. Fill in the title field with a descriptive title about the error
2. Fill in the description field with details about experiencing this error during executions
3. Click the "Create issue" button once it becomes enabled

The title field is already focused, so I'll start by filling it with an appropriate title.

```fill('513', 'OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use during executions')```

Looking at the error message, the click action on the "Create issue" button (bid '629') timed out, but the log shows the element was found, visible, enabled, stable, and the click was performed. The timeout might be due to waiting for navigation after the click. Since the click action was actually performed according to the log, I should wait a moment to see if the page navigates to the newly created issue page, or check if the issue was created successfully.

Let me wait a bit to allow any page navigation to complete, then check the current page state.

Looking at the current state, I can see that I'm now on an issue page titled "OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use during executions (#17)" which indicates that the issue was successfully created and assigned issue number #17. The page shows the issue details including the title, description, status (Open), creation time, and author (Byte Blaze). This confirms that the goal has been accomplished - I've successfully opened an issue to report experiencing "OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use" during executions in aem-hacker.

Since the issue has been created successfully, I should notify the user that the task has been completed.

```send_msg_to_user("Successfully opened issue #17 to report the 'OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use' error during executions in aem-hacker. The issue is now available at http://172.26.116.102:8080/0ang3el/aem-hacker/-/issues/17")```
