Looking at the current page, I can see a list of GitLab projects but I need to find the top eight most starred repos. The current view shows various projects but doesn't clearly display star counts for all of them. I can see some projects have star counts (like "Byte Blaze / a11y-syntax-highlighting" has 3 stars, "Byte Blaze / empathy-prompts" has 9 stars), but I need a better way to identify and sort by star count.

I should navigate to the "Explore projects" section which typically shows projects sorted by popularity/stars, or use the search functionality to find the most starred repositories.

Let me first click on "Explore projects" to see if that gives me a better view of popular projects.

```click("298")```

Looking at the current page, I can see that I'm already on the "Explore projects" page (based on the URL and page title), but the projects aren't sorted by star count. I need to sort the projects by "Most stars" to identify the top eight most starred repositories. I can see there's a "Most stars" link in the list that should sort the projects accordingly.

Let me click on the "Most stars" link to sort the projects by star count.

```click("327")```

Looking at the current page, I can see that I've already navigated to the "Explore projects" page and clicked on "Most stars" to sort by star count. Now I need to identify the top eight most starred repositories from the list and star them. 

From the accessibility tree, I can see several projects with their star counts displayed (like "Meta / create-react-app" with 1,547 stars, "Keycloak / keycloak" with 1,604 stars, etc.). The projects appear to be sorted by star count in descending order, with the highest starred projects at the top.

I need to star the first eight projects in this list. I can see star buttons next to each project (represented by image elements). Let me star the first project by clicking its star button.

```click("375")```

Looking at the current state, I can see I'm on a GitLab issues page for a specific project (AndroidSlidingUpPanel), not on the "Explore projects" page where I was trying to find the most starred repositories. The history shows I was attempting to navigate to explore projects and sort by stars, but I seem to have ended up on a different page.

I need to navigate back to the main GitLab dashboard or explore page to find the most starred repositories. From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a "Dashboard" link at the top that should take me to the main dashboard where I can then navigate to explore projects.

Let me click the "Dashboard" link to get back to the main page.

Looking at the current state, I can see I'm on a GitLab dashboard page showing various projects, but I need to find the top eight most starred repositories.

Looking at the error message, it seems the star button for the second project wasn't visible and couldn't be scrolled into view. This suggests I may need to scroll down to see more projects or the page layout has changed. Let me first scroll down to ensure all the top projects are visible, then continue starring the remaining top repositories.

```scroll(0, 300)```

Let me continue with the third project now that I've scrolled to make more content visible.
