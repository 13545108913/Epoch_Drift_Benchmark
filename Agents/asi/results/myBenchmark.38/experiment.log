Looking at the current page, I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. I need to find the "thoughtbot/administrate" project to check its contributor statistics. Since this project isn't visible in the current view, I should use the search functionality to find it.

The search box is available with bid '156' (based on the accessibility tree showing a searchbox with the label "Search or jump to…"). I'll search for the "thoughtbot/administrate" project.

```search_project('156', 'thoughtbot/administrate')```

Looking at the current page state, I can see that I'm already on a search results page for "thoughtbot/administrate" but it's showing "We couldn't find any projects matching thoughtbot/administrate". The search query appears to be already filled in the search box (bid '256') with the value "thoughtbot/administrate".

Since the search didn't find any projects, I need to reconsider my approach. The current search might be looking across all of GitLab, but perhaps I need to navigate differently or the project might be under a different name. Let me try clicking on the "Projects" tab in the search results to see if that helps narrow down the search.

From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a list of search result categories with "Projects 0" as the first item (bid '313'). Let me click on that to see if it provides more specific project search results.

```click('313')```

Looking at the current situation, I can see that my previous search for "thoughtbot/administrate" returned no results, and clicking on the "Projects" filter also showed 0 results. This suggests that either:

1. The project doesn't exist in this GitLab instance
2. The project has a different name
3. I need to access it through a different method

Since the goal is to find contributor statistics for the thoughtbot/administrate project, and the current GitLab instance doesn't seem to have this project, I should inform the user that the project cannot be found in this environment.

```send_msg_to_user("I searched for the 'thoughtbot/administrate' project but couldn't find it in this GitLab instance. The project may not exist here, may have a different name, or may be in a different Git hosting service like GitHub.")```
