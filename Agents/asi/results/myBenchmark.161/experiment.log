Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on a GitLab project page for "design" under the "Primer" project. The goal is to submit a merge request for the "build time debug" branch to be merged into the "main" branch and assign myself as the reviewer.

From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a "Merge requests" link in the sidebar with a count of 146. This is likely where I need to go to create a new merge request. Let me click on that link to navigate to the merge requests section.

```click("374")```

Looking at the current state, I can see I'm already on the Merge Requests page (as indicated by the active tab title and the breadcrumbs showing "Merge requests"). Now I need to create a new merge request. I can see there's a "New merge request" link in the accessibility tree with bid 561. I should click on that to start creating a new merge request.

```click("561")```

Looking at the current page state, I can see I'm already on the "New merge request" page. The accessibility tree shows the form elements for creating a merge request:

- Source branch selection (currently showing "primer/design" with a dropdown button)
- Target branch selection (currently showing "a11y/context-menu-accessibility-docs")
- A "Compare branches and continue" button

I need to:
1. Change the source branch to "build time debug"
2. Change the target branch to "main"
3. Continue to the next step where I can assign myself as reviewer

Let me start by clicking the "Select source branch" button to choose the correct source branch.

```click("576")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I've successfully selected both the source branch ("debug-build-time") and target branch ("main"). Now I need to proceed to the next step where I can fill in the merge request details and assign myself as reviewer. The "Compare branches and continue" button is visible with bid 659. Clicking this should take me to the merge request creation form where I can complete the submission and assign myself as reviewer.

Looking at the error message, it appears the click action on element "659" (the "Compare branches and continue" button) actually completed successfully - the element was found, clicked, and the navigation started. The timeout error occurred while waiting for the navigation to finish, which suggests the page might be taking longer to load than expected.

Since the navigation was initiated and we're waiting for it to complete, the best approach is to wait a bit longer for the page to fully load before proceeding. The current page state suggests we were in the process of navigating from the branch selection step to the merge request creation form.

Let me wait for the navigation to complete and the new page to load.
