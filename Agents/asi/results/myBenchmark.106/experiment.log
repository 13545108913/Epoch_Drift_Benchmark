Looking at the current page, I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing projects. To follow users 'ghost', 'R1kk3r', and 'Abishek', I need to navigate to the search functionality to find these users. I can see there's a search box in the top navigation with the ID 156.

Let me start by clicking on the search box to search for the first user.<｜end▁of▁thinking｜>I'll start by using the search functionality to find the first user 'ghost'. The search box is available in the top navigation with ID 156.

```click("156")```

I've clicked on the search box. Now I need to enter the username 'ghost' to search for this user. The search box should now be focused and ready for input.

```fill("156", "ghost")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the search box (ID 156) already has "ghost" filled in from my previous action, as shown in the accessibility tree: `searchbox 'Search or jump to…' value='ghost', focused`. The search results are already showing with a link for '"ghost" in all GitLab'. Now I need to execute the search to see the actual results for this user.

```keyboard_press("Enter")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the search has been executed and we're on a search results page for "ghost". The accessibility tree shows we have search result categories like Projects, Issues, Merge requests, Milestones, and Users. Since I need to follow users, I should navigate to the Users section of the search results.

I can see there's a "Users" link in the search results navigation. Let me click on that to filter the search results to show only users.

```click("322")```

Looking at the current state, I can see we're on the search results page for "ghost" and I've clicked on the "Users" filter. The accessibility tree shows we have three user results displayed:

1. Ghost User @ghost
2. Ghost User @ghost1  
3. litghost @litghost

The first user "Ghost User @ghost" matches the username 'ghost' from our goal. I need to click on this user's profile link to navigate to their profile page where I can follow them.

```click("333")```

Looking at the error message, I can see that the click action on element "333" timed out, but the element was found and appeared to be clickable. The element is an `<a>` tag with href="/ghost", which matches the user profile we want to access. The timeout might be due to network latency or page loading.

Since the element was found and appeared ready for interaction, let me try the click action again with a longer wait time to account for any loading delays.

```click("333")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that we're still on the search results page for "ghost" users. The previous click on element "333" (which is the Ghost User profile link) timed out, but the element is still present and should be clickable.

Let me try a different approach. I can see from the accessibility tree that there's a link with the text "Ghost User" that has ID "333". Since this is the user profile we want to access, I'll try clicking it again. The timeout might have been a temporary issue.

```click("333")```

Looking at the current situation, I can see that we're still on the search results page for "ghost" users, and my previous attempts to click on the Ghost User profile link (ID "333") have timed out. The element is clearly present in the accessibility tree as a link to "/ghost", but there seems to be some issue with the interaction.

Let me try a different approach. Since we're trying to follow users and we know the exact username 'ghost', I can try to navigate directly to the user's profile URL instead of relying on the search results click. The URL structure for GitLab user profiles typically follows the pattern of the base URL plus the username.

Given that the current tab is at "http://172.26.116.102:8080/ghost" (which is actually the Ghost User's profile), and we're trying to follow this user, I should look for the follow button on the current page. Let me examine the accessibility tree more carefully.

Looking at the current accessibility tree, I can see there's a link with the text "Unfollow" (ID 275). This suggests that we might already be on a user profile page and there's an option to unfollow, which means we might already be following this user. However, since our goal is to follow 'ghost', let me check if there's a follow button instead.

Let me scroll through the page to see if there are any other follow-related elements that might not be visible in the current view.

```scroll(0, 300)```

Looking at the current situation, I can see we're on the Ghost User's profile page (URL: http://172.26.116.102:8080/ghost). The accessibility tree shows there's an "Unfollow" link (ID 275), which indicates we're already following this user. This means the first user 'ghost' from our goal list is already being followed.

Since we've successfully followed 'ghost', I should now move on to the next user 'R1kk3r'. I need to use the search functionality again to find this user. I can see the search box is still available in the top navigation with ID 156.

Let me click on the search box to search for 'R1kk3r'.
