The action history shows the agent successfully searched for and followed 'ghost' (as indicated by the \"Unfollow\" link in the final state), but the agent did not proceed to search for or follow 'R1kk3r' or 'Abishek'. The final state only confirms the follow status for 'ghost' and the agent's internal thought about needing to search for 'R1kk3r', but no actions were taken for the other two users. Since the task requires following all three users and only one was addressed, the execution is incomplete and unsuccessful.", "uid": 106}]
