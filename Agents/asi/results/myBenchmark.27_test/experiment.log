Looking at the error message, I can see that the previous action failed because `press` is not defined in the action space. The `search_and_select_repository` function uses `press` but the available action is `keyboard_press`. 

I can see from the accessibility tree that "Super_Awesome_Robot" is already showing in the search box (value='Super_Awesome_Robot', focused), and there's a search result list item with the project link. Since the search is already populated and focused, I should just click on the search result link to navigate to the project page.

The search result link has bid '1016' according to the accessibility tree.

```click("1016")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the search for "Super_Awesome_Robot" has already been executed and there's a search result showing the project "Convex Eggtart / Super_Awesome_Robot". The goal is to get the SSH clone command, which would typically be available on the project's main page.

Since the search result is already displayed and contains a link to the project, I should click on that project link to navigate to the project page where I can find the clone command.

From the accessibility tree, I can see the project link has bid '341' (the link inside the heading for "Convex Eggtart / Super_Awesome_Robot").

```click("341")```

Looking at the current page, I can see we're already on the Super_Awesome_Robot project page. The goal is to find the SSH clone command. On GitLab project pages, the clone command is typically available in a "Clone" button or dropdown. 

From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a "Clone" link with bid '710' that contains the text "Clone". This is likely where the clone options (including SSH) are available. I should click on this to reveal the clone commands.

```click("710")```

Looking at the current page state, I can see that the "Clone" link (bid '710') has already been expanded (expanded=True) and is focused. The expanded clone options are visible in the accessibility tree, showing both SSH and HTTP clone commands. 

Specifically, I can see the SSH clone command is displayed in a textbox with value 'git@localhost:convexegg/super_awesome_robot.git' and there's a "Copy URL" button next to it (bid '719'). Since the goal is to show the SSH clone command, I should copy this URL to make it available.

```click("719")```

2025-11-20 18:29:23,519 - 81792 - browsergym.experiments.loop - INFO - action:
Looking at the error message, I can see that the click on the "Copy URL" button (bid '719') failed because another element (bid '762') is intercepting pointer events. This suggests there might be an overlay or another UI element blocking the click.

However, I can see from the accessibility tree that the SSH clone command is already visible in the textbox with value 'git@localhost:convexegg/super_awesome_robot.git'. Since the goal is to "show me the command" rather than actually copy it to clipboard, I can simply read the value and send it to the user.

The SSH clone command is clearly displayed as: `git@localhost:convexegg/super_awesome_robot.git`

I'll send this command directly to the user since it's already visible on the page.

```send_msg_to_user("The SSH command to clone Super_Awesome_Robot is: git@localhost:convexegg/super_awesome_robot.git")```
