Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing projects. I need to find the "a11yproject" project first, then navigate to its issues, find the specific 404 issue, and assign it to Roshanjossey.

From the project list, I can see several projects starting with "a11y" but I don't see one specifically called "a11yproject". Let me search for it using the search functionality.

I can see a search box with bid 156 in the navigation bar that says "Search or jump to…". I'll use that to search for the "a11yproject" repository.

```search_repository('156', 'a11yproject')```
