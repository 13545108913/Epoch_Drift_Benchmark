Looking at the current page, I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing projects. To follow specific users, I need to navigate to their profiles. Since the search functionality is available in the top navigation bar, I can use it to search for the first user 'Jakub Klinkovský'.

The search box has bid 156 according to the accessibility tree, so I'll use that to search for the user.

```click("156")```
