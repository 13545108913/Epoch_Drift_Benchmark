Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the repository page for "gimmiethat.space" (Title Wanted). The accessibility tree shows a sidebar with project navigation, and I can see there's a "Members" link (bid "503") in the sidebar under the project navigation section.

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm already on the "Members" page for the repository "gimmiethat.space" (Title Wanted). The accessibility tree shows a table with all the project members, which includes four users: Benoît Blanchon (@bblanchon), Byte Blaze (@byteblaze - which is you), Jakub Klinkovský (@lahwaacz), and yjlou (@yjlou). 

Since the goal is to show the usernames of who else has access to the repository, and I can see all the members listed in the table, I can now extract this information and send it to the user.

```send_msg_to_user("The following users have access to your repo 'gimmiethat.space':\n- Benoît Blanchon (@bblanchon)\n- Jakub Klinkovský (@lahwaacz)\n- yjlou (@yjlou)\n- Byte Blaze (@byteblaze) - This is you")```
