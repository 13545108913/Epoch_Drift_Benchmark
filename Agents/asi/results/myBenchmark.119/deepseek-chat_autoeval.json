The agent's action history shows that it attempted to fill in fields for the milestone (actions 6 and 8) but then performed a go_back() action, effectively undoing any progress. The final state of the webpage indicates the agent is back at the milestones list page and has not successfully created the milestone. Since the milestone was not created (no confirmation or persistence in the final state), the task is a failure.", "uid": 119}]
