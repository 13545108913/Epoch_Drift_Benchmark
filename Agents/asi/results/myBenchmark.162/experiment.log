Looking at the current page, I can see we're now on the Issues page for the cloud-to-butt repository. I can see there are already 3 existing issues with the title "Let's keep the project alive" that were created previously. The page shows a "New issue" link with bid 624, which is exactly what I need to click to create a new issue.

Since the goal is to create a new issue with the specified title, assign it to myself, and set a due date, I should click the "New issue" button to start the creation process.

```click("624")```
