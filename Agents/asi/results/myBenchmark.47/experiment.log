Looking at the current page, I can see we're on a GitLab project page for "a11yproject.com". The goal is to list all opened issues that report bugs. 

I can see in the accessibility tree that there's an "Issues" link in the project navigation sidebar with a count of "41" issues total. This is the link I need to click to navigate to the issues page where I can then filter for bug reports.

The Issues link in the project navigation has bid "350" according to the accessibility tree.

```click("350")```

Looking at the error message, the click action actually succeeded - the element was found, became visible and stable, and the click was performed. The timeout error appears to be a false positive since the element was successfully clicked. 

Now I need to wait for the page to load after clicking the Issues link, then I can search for bug reports. Let me wait a moment for the issues page to load completely.

```noop(2000)```

Looking at the current page state after clicking the Issues link, I can see we're now on the Issues page. I can see multiple issues listed with various labels like "help wanted", "idea", "enhancement", "article audit", etc. 

I notice one issue that has a "bug" label: issue #15 titled "[Bug] 404s, bad host, timeouts, bad urls for URLs linked from website". This confirms there are bug reports among the open issues.

To list all opened issues that report bugs, I need to filter the issues to show only those with the "bug" label. I can see there's a search box with bid "655" that allows me to search and filter issues. I'll use this to search for issues with the "bug" label.

```fill("655", "label:bug")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I've already filled the search box with "label:bug" to filter for bug reports. The search box has the value "bug" showing, which means the filter has been applied. Now I need to execute this search to see the filtered results showing only bug reports.

I can press Enter to apply the search filter and display only the issues with the "bug" label.

```keyboard_press("Enter")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the search for "label:bug" has been executed and the page is now showing filtered results. I can see two issues in the list that have the "bug" label:

1. Issue #15: "[Bug] 404s, bad host, timeouts, bad urls for URLs linked from website"
2. Issue #28: "Investigate if <details>/<summary> is a good choice for our Checklist"

Both issues are open and have the "bug" label applied. Since the goal is to list all opened issues that report bugs, I can now send this information to the user.

```send_msg_to_user("Found 2 opened issues that report bugs:\n\n1. #15: [Bug] 404s, bad host, timeouts, bad urls for URLs linked from website\n2. #28: Investigate if <details>/<summary> is a good choice for our Checklist")```
