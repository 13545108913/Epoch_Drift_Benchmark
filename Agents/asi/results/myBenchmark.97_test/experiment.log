Looking at the current page state, I can see that the search for "facebook" has been executed but returned no projects. The accessibility tree shows "We couldn't find any projects matching facebook" and "Projects 0" in the results. This means there are no facebook repositories available to fork in this GitLab instance.

Since the goal is to fork all repos from facebook but there are no facebook projects found in this GitLab instance, I should inform the user about this situation.

```send_msg_to_user("The search for 'facebook' returned no projects in this GitLab instance. There are no facebook repositories available to fork.")```
