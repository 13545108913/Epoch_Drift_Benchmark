Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. I need to find the "byteblaze/empathy-prompts" project and navigate to its merge requests to post "lgtm" on the relevant merge request about fixing broken links.

I can see the "Byte Blaze / empathy-prompts" project listed in the project list. I should click on that project link to navigate to its project page first.

```click("580")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the project overview page for "empathy-prompts" which shows the repository is empty. I need to navigate to the merge requests section to find the merge request about fixing broken links. In the accessibility tree, I can see there's a "Merge requests" link in the project navigation sidebar with the label showing "0" merge requests, but the global navigation at the top shows "1" merge request. Let me click on the merge requests link in the project navigation to see the current state.

```click("341")```

Looking at the current state, I can see I'm on the merge requests page for the empathy-prompts project. The accessibility tree shows there are "0" merge requests in the project navigation, but the global navigation at the top shows "1" merge request. This suggests there might be a merge request that needs attention. Since the goal is to post "lgtm" on a merge request about fixing broken links, I should first check if there are any merge requests listed on this page. If none are visible, I may need to look for it in a different location or check if filters are hiding it.

Let me scroll down to see if there are any merge requests that aren't currently visible in the viewport.

```scroll(0, 300)```

Looking at the current situation, I can see that the project navigation sidebar shows "0" merge requests, but the global navigation at the top shows "1" merge request. This discrepancy suggests there might be a merge request that's not visible due to filtering or it might be in a different state. Since I've already scrolled down and haven't found any visible merge requests, I should check if there are any filters applied or if I need to look at all merge requests (including closed ones) to find the one about fixing broken links.

Let me click on the filter button or search functionality to see if I can find the specific merge request about broken links.

```click("176")```

Looking at the current state, I can see I've clicked on the search box (bid 176) which is now focused. The goal is to find a merge request about fixing broken links in the empathy-prompts project. Since the merge requests page shows "0" merge requests in the project navigation but "1" in the global navigation, there might be a merge request that's filtered out or in a different state. I should search for merge requests related to "broken links" to find the specific one I need to comment on.

```fill("176", "broken links")```

Looking at the current state, I've filled the search box with "broken links" but haven't executed the search yet. The search box is focused and contains the text "broken links". To actually perform the search and find the merge request about fixing broken links, I need to press Enter to execute the search query.

```keyboard_press("Enter")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that after searching for "broken links" in the merge requests page, the search results show "We couldn't find any merge requests matching broken links in project Byte Blaze / empathy-prompts". This suggests that either:

1. The merge request doesn't exist in this project
2. The merge request has a different title or description
3. The merge request might be in a different state (closed, merged, etc.)

Since the global navigation shows "1" merge request but the project page shows "0", I should check if there are any filters applied that might be hiding the merge request. Let me check the status filter options to see if the merge request might be in a different state.

```click("361")```

Looking at the error message, I can see that the radio button with bid "361" (for "Open" status) is being intercepted by its label element (bid "362"). This is a common UI pattern where clicking the label also toggles the radio button. Instead of trying to click the radio button directly, I should click on its associated label to change the filter status.

The goal is to find the merge request about fixing broken links. Since searching for "broken links" didn't yield results and the global navigation shows "1" merge request while the project page shows "0", it's likely that the merge request is in a different state (closed or merged). Let me click the label for the "Open" filter to see if that reveals the merge request.

```click("362")```

Looking at the current situation, I can see that after searching for "broken links" in the merge requests page, no results were found. The global navigation shows "1" merge request while the project page shows "0", suggesting the merge request might be in a different state (closed or merged). I've tried clicking the "Open" filter label, but I should actually check other status filters like "Closed" or "Merged" to find the missing merge request about broken links.

Let me click on the "Closed" status filter to see if the merge request is in that state.

```click("368")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I'm on the search results page for "broken links" in merge requests, which returned no results. The global navigation shows "1" merge request while the project page shows "0", suggesting the merge request might be in a different state or have a different title. Since I've already tried searching for "broken links" and filtering by "Open" status without success, I should try filtering by "Closed" or "Merged" status to see if the merge request is in one of those states.

The accessibility tree shows that the "Closed" radio button is currently focused and checked (bid 367), but I need to apply the filter to see the results. I should click the "Apply" button to execute the status filter change.

```click("371")```
