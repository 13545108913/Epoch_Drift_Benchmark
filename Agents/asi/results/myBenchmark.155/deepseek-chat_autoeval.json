The action history shows the agent successfully filled in the group name and slug, but only initiated adding the first member \"ASWATFZLLC\" by filling the search box. The final state indicates the autocomplete menu appeared, but the agent did not select the user from the menu to actually add them to the group. Additionally, the other members (patrickhlauke, westurner, linkmatrix) were not addressed at all. Since the task requires adding multiple members and the agent did not complete adding even the first one, the task is not successfully executed.", "uid": 155}]
