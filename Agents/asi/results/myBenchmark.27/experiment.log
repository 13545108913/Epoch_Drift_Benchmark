Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. I need to find the "Super_Awesome_Robot" project and get its SSH clone command. Since I don't see "Super_Awesome_Robot" in the currently visible project list, I should search for it first.

I can see there's a search box with the description "Search or jump to…" in the accessibility tree at position [156]. This appears to be the global GitLab search functionality that can help me find the project.

```search_repository('156', 'Super_Awesome_Robot')```

Looking at the current page state, I can see that my previous search action was successful - the page is now showing search results for "Super_Awesome_Robot". In the accessibility tree, I can see there's a project result: "Convex Eggtart / Super_Awesome_Robot" with a heading and link at position [340] and [341]. To get the SSH clone command, I need to click on this project link to navigate to the project's main page where the clone options are typically available.

```click('341')```

Looking at the current page state, I can see that the "Clone" section is already expanded (expanded=True) and visible. In the accessibility tree, I can see the SSH clone URL is displayed in a textbox with the value "git@localhost:convexegg/super_awesome_robot.git" at position [717]. The user wants to see the command to clone with SSH, so I should simply send this URL to the user as it contains the complete SSH clone command they need.

```send_msg_to_user("The SSH clone command for Super_Awesome_Robot is: git clone git@localhost:convexegg/super_awesome_robot.git")```
