Looking at the current page, I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. My goal is to open an issue about Python 3.11 resources in "awesome-python". First, I need to find and navigate to the "awesome-python" repository. I can see there's a search box available in the navigation bar that I can use to search for this repository.

The search box has bid '156' according to the accessibility tree, so I'll use that to search for "awesome-python".

```search_repositories('156', 'awesome-python')```

Looking at the current page, I can see that my previous search for "awesome-python" was successful - the search results show the "Vinta Chen / awesome-python" repository in the results. Now I need to click on this repository link to navigate to the actual repository page where I can then create an issue.

From the accessibility tree, I can see the repository link has bid '338' (the heading link for "Vinta Chen / awesome-python"). I should click on this link to go to the repository page.

```click('338')```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the "awesome-python" repository page. I can see various repository information including the README.md file and the project description. To open an issue about Python 3.11 resources, I need to navigate to the Issues section of this repository.

From the accessibility tree, I can see there's an "Issues" link in the project navigation sidebar with bid '344'. This should take me to the issues page where I can then create a new issue.

```click('344')```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the Issues page for the "awesome-python" repository. I can see a list of existing issues, and I notice there's already an issue titled "Plans for Python 3.11 related resources?" (issue #512) that was created 3 days ago by "Byte Blaze". This appears to be exactly what I was trying to create.

Since the goal was to open an issue about Python 3.11 resources and this issue already exists, I should inform the user about this existing issue rather than creating a duplicate.

```send_msg_to_user("I found that an issue about Python 3.11 resources already exists! There's an issue titled 'Plans for Python 3.11 related resources?' (issue #512) that was created 3 days ago by Byte Blaze. You might want to check this existing issue first before creating a new one.")```
