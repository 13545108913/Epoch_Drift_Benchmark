Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on a GitLab dashboard showing projects, but I need to fork all repos from Facebook. The current page only shows projects from "Byte Blaze" and other users/groups, not Facebook repositories.

To accomplish the goal of forking Facebook repos, I first need to navigate to Facebook's GitLab organization or search for Facebook repositories. The search functionality appears to be available in the navigation bar.

I'll use the search box to find Facebook repositories first, then I can work on forking them.

```click("156")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I've clicked on the search box (bid 156), but I haven't entered any search query yet. To find Facebook repositories, I need to type "facebook" into the search box and execute the search.

```fill("156", "facebook")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I've filled the search box with "facebook", but I haven't executed the search yet. The accessibility tree shows that the search box now has the value 'facebook' and there's already a search result visible: "facebook" in all GitLab. To proceed with the search and see all Facebook repositories, I need to press Enter to execute the search.

```keyboard_press("Enter")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the search for "facebook" has already been executed (as evidenced by the URL containing the search query and the page showing search results). The accessibility tree indicates that no projects matching "facebook" were found, which suggests there might not be any Facebook repositories in this GitLab instance, or they might be under a different name or organization.

However, I notice the search results show tabs for different types of results (Projects, Issues, Merge requests, etc.). The current view shows "Projects 0" results, but there might be other types of results available. Let me check if there are any repositories under different categories or if I need to refine my search approach.

Since the goal is to fork repositories, I should first verify if there are any repositories by checking other search result categories or adjusting the search parameters.

```click("312")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the search for "facebook" has been executed and is showing results, but they appear to be mostly issues from Meta/buck and other projects rather than actual repositories. The search results are currently filtered to show "Issues" (as indicated by the "Issues 99+" tab being active).

To find repositories to fork, I need to switch to the "Projects" tab in the search results, which would show actual GitLab projects/repositories matching "facebook" rather than just issues.

```click("309")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I've clicked on the "Projects" tab in the search results, but the page shows "We couldn't find any projects matching facebook" with a count of 0 projects. This means there are no Facebook repositories available in this GitLab instance to fork.

Since the goal is to fork all repos from Facebook, but no Facebook repositories exist in this GitLab instance, I should inform the user that this task cannot be completed here.

```send_msg_to_user("No Facebook repositories were found in this GitLab instance. The search returned 0 projects matching 'facebook'. You may need to check if Facebook repositories are available in this GitLab or if you have access to them.")```
