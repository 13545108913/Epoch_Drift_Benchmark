Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing projects. I need to create an issue in the "dotfiles" repository. I can see the "Byte Blaze / dotfiles" project listed in the projects list. I should click on that project link to navigate to the repository page where I can create an issue.

The dotfiles project link has bid '338' according to the accessibility tree.

```click("338")```

Looking at the current state, I can see I'm already on the dotfiles repository page (Tab 0 shows "Byte Blaze / dotfiles · GitLab" as the title). I can see the project navigation sidebar on the left with various options including "Issues" which has bid '347'. To create a new issue, I need to navigate to the Issues section first.

```click("347")```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the Issues page for the dotfiles repository. I can see there are already 3 issues listed, including one with the exact title "add support for oh-my-zsh" that already exists (issue #1). This issue appears to already be assigned to Abishek S and has the due date set to July 18, 2033, which matches exactly what the user wants to create.

Since the issue with the exact specifications already exists, I should inform the user about this rather than trying to create a duplicate issue.

```send_msg_to_user("I found that an issue with title 'add support for oh-my-zsh' already exists (issue #1) and it's already assigned to Abishek S with due date July 18, 2033. No need to create a new issue as it already exists with the exact specifications you requested.")```
