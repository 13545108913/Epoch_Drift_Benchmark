Looking at the current page, I can see we're on the GitLab dashboard showing projects. The goal is to post "lgtm" for a merge request related to a semantic HTML post in the a11yproject/a11yproject.com project.

First, I need to navigate to the a11yproject/a11yproject.com project. I can see there's a search box available (bid 156) that I can use to search for this project.

```click("156")```

Looking at the current state, I've clicked on the search box (bid 156) but haven't entered the project name yet. I need to search for the specific project "a11yproject/a11yproject.com" to find the merge request related to the semantic HTML post.

```fill("156", "a11yproject/a11yproject.com")```

I can see that I've filled the search box with "a11yproject/a11yproject.com" but haven't executed the search yet. Looking at the accessibility tree, I can see there's a search result already showing: a link for '"a11yproject/a11yproject.com" in all GitLab' with bid 1033. I should click on this result to navigate to the project.

```click("1033")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the search has been executed and there are search results showing. The accessibility tree indicates there are different categories of results: Projects (0 results), Issues, Merge requests, Milestones, and Users. Since the goal is to find a merge request related to a semantic HTML post, I should click on the "Merge requests" link in the search results to see the relevant merge requests.

```click("319")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that clicking on the "Merge requests" link in the search results showed "0" results for merge requests matching "a11yproject/a11yproject.com". The page displays a message saying "We couldn't find any merge requests matching a11yproject/a11yproject.com".

Since the search didn't find any merge requests, I need to navigate directly to the a11yproject/a11yproject.com project first, then look for merge requests from there. I should use the project search functionality to find and navigate to the actual project repository.

```search_and_select_repository("256", "a11yproject/a11yproject.com")```

Looking at the error message, I see that the `search_and_select_repository` function uses `press` which is not defined in the available actions. I need to use the available `keyboard_press` action instead. 

Since the search is already showing results but no merge requests were found, I should navigate directly to the project first. I can see there's a search box with bid 256 that's already filled with "a11yproject/a11yproject.com". I should press Enter to execute the search and then look for the project in the results.

```keyboard_press("Enter")```

Looking at the current state, I can see that pressing Enter executed the search but we're still on the search results page showing "0" merge requests. The search results show different categories (Projects, Issues, Merge requests, etc.), but we need to navigate to the actual project first to find merge requests. 

Since the search for merge requests directly returned no results, I should click on the "Projects" link in the search results to see if the project itself appears there, then navigate to the project repository where I can find its merge requests.

```click("313")```

Looking at the current situation, I can see that clicking on the "Projects" link in the search results (bid 313) timed out and we're still on the same search page. The search results show "0" projects matching "a11yproject/a11yproject.com", which suggests the project might not exist or I need a different approach.

Since the direct search isn't finding the project, I should try to navigate to the project using a direct URL approach. I can use the `goto` action to navigate directly to the project's URL, which would be something like `http://172.26.116.102:8080/a11yproject/a11yproject.com`.

```goto("http://172.26.116.102:8080/a11yproject/a11yproject.com")```

Looking at the current situation, I can see that the direct navigation to the project URL was successful - we're now on the a11yproject/a11yproject.com project page. The accessibility tree shows we're on the repository view with files and commits. 

Now I need to find the merge requests for this project. I can see in the navigation sidebar there's a "Merge requests" link with bid 377. This should take me to the merge requests section where I can find the semantic HTML post-related merge request.

```click("377")```

Looking at the current state, I can see we've successfully navigated to the a11yproject/a11yproject.com project page and clicked on the "Merge requests" link (bid 377). The accessibility tree shows we're now on the merge requests page for this project, but it indicates there are "0" merge requests (shown in the sidebar with bid 376). 

The main content area shows a heading about what merge requests are and a "New merge request" link, suggesting there are currently no open merge requests in this project. Since the goal is to post "lgtm" for a merge request related to a semantic HTML post, I need to check if there are any merge requests at all, including closed ones, or if I need to navigate differently.

Let me first check if there are any merge requests by looking for them in the main content area or checking if there's a filter to show all merge requests (including closed ones).

```noop()```
