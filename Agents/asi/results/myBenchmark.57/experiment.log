Looking at the goal to "Fork 2019-nCov" and the current page showing a list of projects, I can see several 2019-nCov repositories listed from different owners/organizations (x-lab, n-lab, webagent, coding_friends, crew). To fork a repository, I need to first navigate to the specific repository page, then find and click the fork button.

I can see "x-lab / 2019-nCov" is listed in the project list. I'll click on this project link to navigate to its repository page where I should be able to find the fork option.

```click("385")```
