Looking at the current page, I'm on a GitLab dashboard showing projects. To accomplish the goal of displaying issues with flaky-test labels in the keycloak/keycloak repository, I need to:

1. First, navigate to the keycloak/keycloak repository
2. Then access its issues section
3. Filter for issues with flaky-test related labels

The most direct approach is to use the search functionality to find the keycloak/keycloak repository. I can see there's a search box available with bid [156] that says "Search or jump to…". This should allow me to search for the repository.

```search_project('156', 'keycloak/keycloak')```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the search for "keycloak/keycloak" has already been executed but returned no projects. The page shows "We couldn't find any projects matching keycloak/keycloak". This suggests that either the repository doesn't exist in this GitLab instance or I need to navigate differently.

Since the goal is to find issues with flaky-test labels in the keycloak/keycloak repository, and the current search isn't finding the project, I should try navigating to the Issues section directly to see if I can access issues across all repositories and then filter from there. I can see there's an "Issues" link in the navigation with bid [155].

```navigate_to_issues('155')```

Looking at the current situation, I've tried searching for the keycloak/keycloak repository directly but it wasn't found in this GitLab instance. Since the goal is to display issues with flaky-test labels from that specific repository, I need to reconsider my approach.

The current page shows I'm on an Issues dashboard, but it's displaying issues assigned to me across various repositories. I need to find a way to access the keycloak/keycloak repository specifically. Since the direct search didn't work, I should try a different approach - perhaps I need to navigate to the "Explore" or "Projects" section to browse available repositories, or there might be a way to search for issues across all repositories with specific labels.

Let me try accessing the Projects section first to see what repositories are available in this GitLab instance.

```click('69')```

Looking at the current state, I can see that I'm still on the GitLab dashboard and the Projects dropdown is now expanded. I can see options like "Your projects", "Starred projects", "Explore projects", etc. Since the direct search for "keycloak/keycloak" didn't find the repository, I should try exploring all available projects to see if it exists in this GitLab instance. The "Explore projects" option would show me all accessible repositories.

```click('80')```

Looking at the current situation, I've tried several approaches to find the keycloak/keycloak repository but haven't been successful. The direct search didn't find it, and I'm now on the "Explore projects" page which shows various repositories but none appear to be keycloak/keycloak. 

Given that this appears to be a different GitLab instance than the official one (the URL is an internal IP address), it's likely that the keycloak/keycloak repository doesn't exist in this specific GitLab installation. The repositories shown are from various users/groups like "Byte Blaze", "coding_friends", "x-lab", etc., but no "keycloak" organization or repository.

Since the goal cannot be accomplished in this environment, I should report this as infeasible.

```report_infeasible("The keycloak/keycloak repository does not appear to exist in this GitLab instance. The available repositories belong to different users and organizations, but no keycloak project was found through search or browsing.")```
