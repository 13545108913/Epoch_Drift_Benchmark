Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. I need to find the "a11yproject" repository and then navigate to its commit history to count Eric's commits on 3/2.

First, I should search for the "a11yproject" repository since it's not immediately visible in the current project list. I can see there's a search box with the description "Filter by name..." which should help me find the project.

I'll use the search_project function to search for "a11yproject". From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a searchbox with bid '303' that has the description "Filter by name...", which is perfect for this task.

```search_project('303', 'a11yproject')```

Looking at the current state, I can see that the search has already been performed - the search box with bid '303' shows "a11yproject" as its value, and the project "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" is now visible in the results. 

Since the project is now visible, I should click on it to navigate to the project page where I can access the repository and commit history.

I can see the project link has the text "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" and appears to be a clickable link. From the accessibility tree, I can see this is a heading with a link inside it. I'll click on this project link to open the project page.

```click('353')```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm now on the a11yproject.com project page in GitLab. I need to find Eric's commits from March 2nd. To do this, I should navigate to the repository's commit history where I can filter and count commits.

From the accessibility tree, I can see there's a "Repository" section in the sidebar navigation (bid '319') and a "History" link (bid '778') that appears to be related to commit history. The "History" link seems like the most direct way to access the commit history.

I'll click on the "History" link to view the commit history where I can then filter for Eric's commits on March 2nd.

```click('778')```

Looking at the current page, I can see I'm on the commit history page for the "add-color-utility-classes" branch of the a11yproject.com repository. The page shows commits grouped by date, but I need to find commits specifically from March 2nd and count Eric Bailey's contributions.

From the accessibility tree, I can see the commits are listed with dates like "25 Aug, 2020", "22 Aug, 2020", etc. These are all from August 2020, which doesn't include March 2nd. I need to either:

1. Scroll to load more commits (since March would be earlier than August)
2. Use the search functionality to filter commits by date and author

I notice there's a searchbox with bid '660' labeled "Search by message" - this could help me search for commits. However, to find commits from March 2nd specifically, I might need to either scroll to load older commits or use a different approach.

Let me first try scrolling to load more commits, as March would be earlier in the timeline than the currently displayed August dates.

```scroll(0, -500)```

Looking at the current state, I can see that scrolling didn't reveal any earlier commits - all the commits shown are from August 2020, which is much later than the March 2nd date we're looking for. The commit history appears to be limited to this specific branch "add-color-utility-classes" and only shows recent activity.

To find Eric's commits from March 2nd, I need to:
1. Either switch to the main/default branch where more historical commits would be visible
2. Or navigate to a broader commit history view that includes all branches

I can see there's a branch selector button with bid '583' showing "add-color-utility-classes". Clicking this might allow me to switch to a different branch like "main" where I could find older commits from March.

Let me click the branch selector to see if I can switch to the main branch where the full commit history would be available.

```click('583')```

Looking at the current state, I can see that clicking the branch selector opened a dropdown menu showing various branches including "main" (bid '1629'). Since I need to find commits from March 2nd and the current branch "add-color-utility-classes" only shows commits from August 2020, I should switch to the "main" branch where the full commit history would be available.

I'll click on the "main" branch link to switch to that branch's commit history, which should include older commits from March.

```click('1629')```

Looking at the error, I can see that the click on the "main" branch link is being intercepted by other elements in the commit list. The branch dropdown is likely still open but overlapped by the commit list content. 

I should first close the branch dropdown by clicking somewhere else or using the "Close" button (bid '590') that appears to be available in the dropdown interface. This will clear the overlay and allow me to interact with the page properly.

Let me click the "Close" button to dismiss the branch dropdown first.

```click('590')```

Looking at the error, I can see that the branch dropdown is being blocked by the commit list content. The "Close" button (bid '590') is being intercepted by commit list items. I need a different approach to close the dropdown.

Since the branch dropdown is open and interfering with interactions, I should try pressing the Escape key to close it instead of trying to click the "Close" button. This is a common keyboard shortcut for closing dropdowns and modals.

```keyboard_press('Escape')```

Looking at the current situation, I can see that the branch dropdown is still open and interfering with interactions. The Escape key press should have closed it, but let me verify the current state and try a different approach.

Since I need to access the main branch's commit history to find March 2nd commits, and the branch dropdown is causing issues, I should try navigating directly to the main branch's commit history URL. From the current URL structure, I can see we're on the "add-color-utility-classes" branch commit page. I can modify the URL to go to the main branch commit history directly.

The current URL is: `http://172.26.116.102:8080/a11yproject/a11yproject.com/-/commits/add-color-utility-classes/`

I can navigate to the main branch commit history by changing the URL to: `http://172.26.116.102:8080/a11yproject/a11yproject.com/-/commits/main/`

```goto('http://172.26.116.102:8080/a11yproject/a11yproject.com/-/commits/main/')```

Looking at the current situation, I can see that the direct navigation to the main branch commit history timed out. The branch dropdown is still open and interfering with interactions. Let me try a different approach - I'll use the browser's back button to navigate away from the current problematic state and then try to access the main branch commit history through the repository navigation.

Since I'm currently on a specific branch's commit history page and the branch dropdown is causing issues, going back to the project page and then navigating to the main branch commit history through the sidebar might be more reliable.

```go_back()```
