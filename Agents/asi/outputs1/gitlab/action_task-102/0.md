## Task: Star the top {{number}} most stared repos in Gitlab
### Example 1 (102): Star the top one most stared repos in Gitlab
Clicked "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" to navigate to its project page for starring.
```click("465")```
Clicked the Star button to star the repository, increasing the star count from 21 to 22.
```click("531")```
Confirmed that the repository is already starred, as indicated by the "Unstar" button and 22 stars count.
```send_msg_to_user("The repository 'The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com' is already starred with 22 stars, which appears to be the highest star count.")```


```python
def star_repository(repo_link_id: str, star_button_id: str):
    """Star a GitLab repository by clicking its link and then the star button.
    
    Args:
        repo_link_id: The ID of the repository link element
        star_button_id: The ID of the star button element
        
    Returns:
        None
        
    Examples:
        star_repository('465', '531')
        star_repository('789', '890')
    """
    click(repo_link_id)  # Click on repository link to navigate to its page
    click(star_button_id)  # Click star button to star the repository
```
