## Reusable Functions
```python
def search_and_select_repository(search_box_id: str, repo_name: str):
    """Search for a repository and select it from search results.
    
    Args:
        search_box_id: The ID of the search box element
        repo_name: The name of the repository to search for
        
    Returns:
        None
        
    Examples:
        search_and_select_repository('142', 'ChatGPT')
    """
    click(search_box_id)
    fill(search_box_id, repo_name)
    keyboard_press("Enter")
    click("281")  # Click on the repository from search results
```

```python
def get_ssh_clone_command():
    """Get the SSH clone command for the current repository.
    
    Args:
        None
        
    Returns:
        None
        
    Examples:
        get_ssh_clone_command()
    """
    click("493")  # Click Clone button to reveal SSH options
    # Note: The actual SSH URL would be extracted from the page
    # For this example, we assume the command is available after clicking
```

## Rewritten Trajectory
### Example 1: Show me the command to clone ChatGPT with SSH.
```
search_and_select_repository('142', 'ChatGPT')
get_ssh_clone_command()
send_msg_to_user("The SSH clone command for ChatGPT is: git clone git@localhost:convexegg/chatgpt.git")
