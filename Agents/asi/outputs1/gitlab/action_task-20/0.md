Clicked the Issues link to access the issues dashboard for searching and filtering issues.
```click("161")```

```send_msg_to_user("The issue 'Better sharing solution' (#10) is currently open, not closed.")```


```python
def navigate_to_issues(issues_link_id: str):
    """Navigate to the issues dashboard.
    
    Args:
        issues_link_id: The ID of the Issues link
        
    Returns:
        None
        
    Examples:
        navigate_to_issues('161')
    """
    click(issues_link_id)  # Click on Issues link to access issues dashboard

    status_element = page.get_by_test_id("issue-status")
    status_text = status_element.inner_text()
    if "closed" in status_text.lower():
        send_msg_to_user(f"The issue is currently closed.")
    else:
