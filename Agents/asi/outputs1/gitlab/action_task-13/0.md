## Task: Tell me the full names of the repositories where I made contributions and they got {{description}} stars?
### Example 1 (13): Tell me the full names of the repositories where I made contributions and they got more than 100 stars?
Scrolled down to view more repositories and check for higher star counts.
```scroll(0, 500)```
Scrolled down to view more repositories and check for those with over 100 stars.
```scroll(0, 500)```
Scrolled down the page to find repositories with more than 100 stars.
```scroll(0, 500)```
Scrolled through all repositories and confirmed none have over 100 stars, concluding no repositories meet the criteria.
```send_msg_to_user("Based on my review of all 14 repositories in your GitLab dashboard, none of them have more than 100 stars. The repositories with the highest star counts are 'The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com' and 'Primer / design', both with 21 stars.")```
