## Task: Tell me the {{attribute}} of the contributor who has the most commits to branch {{branch_name}}
### Example 1 (150): Tell me the number of commits of the contributor who has the most commits to branch main
Clicked the "History" link to access the commit history page for contributor statistics.
```click('587')```
Clicked the Contributors link to access the contributor statistics page showing commit counts by contributor.
```click('270')```
Viewed the Contributors page to identify Vinta Chen as the top contributor with 414 commits.
```send_msg_to_user("The contributor with the most commits to the main branch is Vinta Chen with 414 commits.")```


```python
def navigate_to_contributors(history_id: str, contributors_id: str):
    """Navigate from repository page to contributors statistics page.
    
    Args:
        history_id: The ID of the "History" link
        contributors_id: The ID of the "Contributors" link
        
    Returns:
        None
        
    Examples:
        navigate_to_contributors('587', '270')
    """
    click(history_id)  # Click History link to access commit history
    click(contributors_id)  # Click Contributors link to access contributor statistics
```
