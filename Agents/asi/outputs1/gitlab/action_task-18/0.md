## Task: Open my latest updated issue that has keyword "{{keyword}}" in its title to check if it is closed
### Example 1 (18): Open my latest updated issue that has keyword "better" in its title to check if it is closed
Clicked the Issues link to navigate to the assigned issues page for searching issues with "better" in the title.
```click("161")```
Clicked the "Better sharing solution" issue to view its details and check its status.
```click("453")```
Determined the issue is open by checking its status on the issue page.
```send_msg_to_user("The issue 'Better sharing solution (#10)' is currently open, not closed.")```


```python
def search_and_open_issue_by_keyword(issues_link_id: str, keyword: str):
    """Search for and open the latest issue containing a specific keyword in the title.
    
    Args:
        issues_link_id: The ID of the Issues navigation link
        keyword: The keyword to search for in issue titles
        
    Returns:
        None
        
    Examples:
        search_and_open_issue_by_keyword('161', 'better')
        search_and_open_issue_by_keyword('161', 'bug')
    """
    click(issues_link_id)  # Navigate to issues page
    # Assuming the latest issue with the keyword is visible on the first page
    # This would typically involve searching/filtering, but for simplicity we assume it's visible
    # In a real implementation, we'd need to add search/filter logic here
```

```python
def check_issue_status_and_notify():
    """Check if the current issue is closed and notify the user.
    
    Args:
        None
        
    Returns:
        None
        
    Examples:
        check_issue_status_and_notify()
    """
    # Check the status indicator on the issue page
    # Assuming the status is visible and we can determine if it's closed
    status_element = page.get_by_text("Status:")
    if "closed" in status_element.inner_text().lower():
        send_msg_to_user("The issue is currently closed.")
    else:
        send_msg_to_user("The issue is currently open, not closed.")
```

## Rewritten Trajectory
### Example 1: Open my latest updated issue that has keyword "better" in its title to check if it is closed
```
search_and_open_issue_by_keyword('161', 'better')
click('453')
check_issue_status_and_notify()
```
