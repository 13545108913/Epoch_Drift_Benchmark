## Task: Add the following users to my {{repo}} as {{role}}: {{user_list}}
### Example 1 (115): Add the following users to my time tracking tool as guest: ['yjlou']
Clicked the "Byte Blaze / timeit" project link to access the time tracking tool's settings for adding users.
```click("352")```
Clicked the Members link to access the project members management page.
```click("500")```
Informed the user that 'yjlou' is already added as a guest on the Project members page.
```send_msg_to_user("User 'yjlou' is already added as a guest member to the timeit project. They appear in the members list with the Guest role.")```


```python
def navigate_to_project_members(project_id: str, members_link_id: str):
    """Navigate from project page to members management page.
    
    Args:
        project_id: The ID of the project link
        members_link_id: The ID of the Members link
        
    Returns:
        None
        
    Examples:
        navigate_to_project_members('352', '500')
        navigate_to_project_members('123', '456')
    """
    click(project_id)  # Click project link
