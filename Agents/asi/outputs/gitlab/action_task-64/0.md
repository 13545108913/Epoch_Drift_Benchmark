## Task: Make the LICENSE of {{repo}} to one that mandates all copies and derivative works to be under the same license
### Example 1 (64): Make the LICENSE of byteblaze/a11y-syntax-highlighting to one that mandates all copies and derivative works to be under the same license
Clicked the "Byte Blaze / a11y-syntax-highlighting" project link to navigate to the repository page for accessing the LICENSE file.
```click("341")```
Opened the LICENSE file to view and edit it for changing to a copyleft license.
```click("939")```
Clicked the Edit link to modify the LICENSE file and change the license type.
```click("651")```
Replaced the MIT license with a concise GPL v3 declaration in the LICENSE file to establish copyleft requirements.
