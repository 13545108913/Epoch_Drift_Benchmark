    Args:
        search_box_id: The ID of the search box element
        repo_name: The name of the repository to search for

    """
    click(search_box_id)
    fill(search_box_id, repo_name)
    click('1040')  # Repository link from search results
```

```python
def get_ssh_clone_command(clone_button_id: str):
    """Get the SSH clone command for a repository.
    
    Args:
