## Task: Add the following users to repo {{repo}} as {{role}}: {{user_list}}
### Example 1 (112): Add the following users to repo a11y-webring.club as developer: ['abisubramanya27', 'lahwaacz']
Clicked the "a11y-webring.club" repository link to navigate to its page for member management.
```click("847")```
Clicked the Members link to access member management settings for adding developers.
```click("500")```
Informed the user that both users are already members with Developer roles, so no action was needed.
```send_msg_to_user("Both users 'abisubramanya27' and 'lahwaacz' are already members of the a11y-webring.club repository with Developer role, as shown in the current members list. No action needed.")```


```python
def navigate_to_repo_members(repo_id: str, members_link_id: str):
    """Navigate to the members management page of a repository.
    
    Args:
        repo_id: The ID of the repository link
        members_link_id: The ID of the members link
        
    Returns:
        None

    click(repo_id)  # Click repository link
    click(members_link_id)  # Click members link

    user_list_str = ", ".join([f"'{user}'" for user in users])
    send_msg_to_user(f"All users {user_list_str} are already members of the {repo_name} repository with {role.title()} role, as shown in the current members list. No action needed.")
