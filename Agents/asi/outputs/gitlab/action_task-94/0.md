## Task: {{name}} wants to check my dotfile configurations. Please invite him to the repo as a guest.
### Example 1 (94): Koushik wants to check my dotfile configurations. Please invite him to the repo as a guest.
Clicked the "Byte Blaze / dotfiles" project link to navigate to the repository page for inviting Koushik as a guest.
```click("483")```
Clicked the Members link to access the member management page for adding new members.
```click("500")```
Filled the search box with Koushik's username to enable the invite button for member invitation.
```fill("603", "koush")```
Selected Koushik Dutta from the dropdown list to enable the invite button.
```keyboard_press("Enter")```
No action was taken as Koushik Dutta was already a member with Guest permissions.
```send_msg_to_user("Koushik Dutta (@koush) is already a member of the dotfiles repository with Guest permissions, so no action is needed.")```
