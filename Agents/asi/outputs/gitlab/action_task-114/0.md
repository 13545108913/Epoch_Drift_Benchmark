## Task: Add the following users to repo {{repo}} as {{role}}: {{user_list}}
### Example 1 (114): Add the following users to repo millennials-to-snake-people as reporter: ['yjlou', 'a11yproject']
Clicked the repository link "Byte Blaze / millennials-to-snake-people" to navigate to the project page.
```click('338')```
Clicked the Members link to access the Members section for managing user permissions and roles.
```click('500')```
Attempted to add "yjlou" as a reporter using the invitation form to verify existing member status.
```add_user_with_role('603', 'yjlou', '611', 'Reporter')```
No action was taken as both users were already members with the correct "Reporter" role.
```send_msg_to_user("Both users 'yjlou' and 'a11yproject' are already members of the repository with 'Reporter' role. No action needed as the goal is already satisfied.")```
