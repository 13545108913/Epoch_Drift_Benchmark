## Task: Display the list of issues in the {{repo}} repository that have labels related to {{label}}
### Example 1 (5): Display the list of issues in the keycloak/keycloak repository that have labels related to flaky-test
Searched for the keycloak/keycloak repository using the search box to navigate to it.
```search_project('156', 'keycloak/keycloak')```
Navigated to the Issues section to search for flaky-test labels across all repositories after the project search returned no results.
```navigate_to_issues('155')```
Navigated to the Projects section to browse available repositories and locate the keycloak/keycloak repository.
```click('69')```
Clicked "Explore projects" to view all accessible repositories and search for the "keycloak/keycloak" repository.
```click('80')```
Determined that the keycloak/keycloak repository does not exist in this GitLab instance and reported the task as infeasible.
```report_infeasible("The keycloak/keycloak repository does not appear to exist in this GitLab instance. The available repositories belong to different users and organizations, but no keycloak project was found through search or browsing.")```
