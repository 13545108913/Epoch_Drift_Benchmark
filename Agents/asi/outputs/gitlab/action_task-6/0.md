## Task: Display the list of issues in the {{repo}} repository that have labels related to {{label}}
### Example 1 (6): Display the list of issues in the umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel repository that have labels related to BUG
Searched for the "umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel" repository to navigate to it.
```search_project('156', 'umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel')```
Clicked the Issues link to access the issues dashboard for filtering by repository and labels.
```click("155")```
Searched for "umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel" in the issues dashboard to filter issues from that specific repository.
```search_issues('360', 'umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel')```
Cleared the search and performed a new search for "AndroidSlidingUpPanel" to verify repository existence and check for issues.
```fill('360', 'AndroidSlidingUpPanel')```
Reported that the target repository's issues could not be found, suggesting it may not exist, have no issues, or be inaccessible.
```send_msg_to_user("I've searched for the umano/AndroidSlidingUpPanel repository but cannot find it in this GitLab instance. The repository either doesn't exist here, has no issues, or I don't have access to view its issues. You may need to verify the repository name or check if it exists in this GitLab installation.")```
