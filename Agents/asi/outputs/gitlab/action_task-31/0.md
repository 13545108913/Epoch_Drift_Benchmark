## Task: Show me the command to clone {{repo}} with SSH.
### Example 1 (31): Show me the command to clone the most stared Covid location tracker with SSH.
Clicked the first "2019-nCov" project to access its repository page and find the SSH clone command.
```click("385")```
Clicked the Clone button to reveal the clone command options for the COVID-19 location tracker repository.
```click("837")```
Summarized the visible SSH clone command from the expanded Clone button.
```send_msg_to_user("The SSH command to clone this COVID location tracker repository is: git clone git@localhost:x-lab1/2019-nCov.git")```


## Reusable Functions
```python
def get_ssh_clone_command(repo_link_id: str | int, clone_button_id: str | int):
    """Get the SSH clone command for a repository.
    
    Args:
        repo_link_id: The ID of the repository link to click
        clone_button_id: The ID of the clone button to click
        
    Returns:
        None
        
    Examples:
        get_ssh_clone_command('385', '837')
    """
    click(repo_link_id)  # Click on the repository link
    click(clone_button_id)  # Click the clone button to reveal clone options
```

## Rewritten Trajectory
### Example 1: Show me the command to clone the most stared Covid location tracker with SSH.
```
get_ssh_clone_command('385', '837')
send_msg_to_user("The SSH command to clone this COVID location tracker repository is: git clone git@localhost:x-lab1/2019-nCov.git")
```
