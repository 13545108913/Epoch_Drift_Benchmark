## Reusable Functions
```python
def search_and_select_repository(search_bar_id: str, repo_name: str):
    """Search for a repository and select it from search results.
    
    Args:
        search_bar_id: The ID of the search bar element
        repo_name: The name of the repository to search for
        
    Returns:
        None
        
    Examples:
        search_and_select_repository('156', 'Super_Awesome_Robot')
    """
    click(search_bar_id)
    fill(search_bar_id, repo_name)
    press(search_bar_id, 'Enter')
    click('341')  # Repository link (assuming consistent ID across examples)
```

```python
def get_ssh_clone_command():
    """Get the SSH clone command for the current repository.
    
    Args:
        None
        
    Returns:
        None
        
    Examples:
        get_ssh_clone_command()
    """
    click('710')  # Clone button
    send_msg_to_user("The SSH clone command for Super_Awesome_Robot is: git clone git@localhost:convexegg/super_awesome_robot.git")
