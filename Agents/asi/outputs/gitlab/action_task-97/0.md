## Task: Fork {{repo}}.
### Example 1 (97): Fork all repos from facebook.
Used the search box to find Facebook repositories for forking.
```click("156")```
Typed "facebook" into the search box to find Facebook repositories.
```fill("156", "facebook")```
Pressed Enter to execute the search for "facebook" and view all Facebook repositories.
```keyboard_press("Enter")```
Switched from Projects to other search result categories to find repositories for forking, after the initial search for "facebook" returned no project matches.
```click("312")```
Switched from the Issues tab to the Projects tab to view repositories matching "facebook" instead of issues.
```click("309")```
Informed the user that forking Facebook repositories is not possible as no matching projects exist in this GitLab instance.
```send_msg_to_user("No Facebook repositories were found in this GitLab instance. The search returned 0 projects matching 'facebook'. You may need to check if Facebook repositories are available in this GitLab or if you have access to them.")```


## Reusable Functions
```python
def search_repositories(search_box_id: str | int, search_term: str):
    """Search for repositories using the search box.
    
    Args:
        search_box_id: The ID of the search box element
        search_term: The term to search for
        
    Returns:
        None
        
    Examples:
        search_repositories('156', 'facebook')
        search_repositories('search_box', 'microsoft')
    """
    click(search_box_id)
    fill(search_box_id, search_term)
    keyboard_press("Enter")
```

```python
def switch_search_tab(from_tab_id: str | int, to_tab_id: str | int):
    """Switch between different search result categories/tabs.
    
    Args:
        from_tab_id: The ID of the current active tab
        to_tab_id: The ID of the target tab to switch to
        
    Returns:
        None
        
    Examples:
        switch_search_tab('312', '309')
        switch_search_tab('projects_tab', 'repositories_tab')
    """
    click(from_tab_id)
    click(to_tab_id)
