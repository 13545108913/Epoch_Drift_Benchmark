</tools>

2. **Python Code Execution**
When executing Python code, please output:
<code>
... your code ...
</code>
- The working directory is `workspace`
- Executing dangerous, destructive, or time-consuming code is prohibited.
- If both a **Tool Call** and **Python Code Execution** are included in the output, the tool call takes precedence, and the Python code will not be executed.
- Using outdated or limited python libraries may result in incomplete or inaccurate observations (e.g. missing images from PDFs or failing to extract key content). Always prefer robust, modern libraries to ensure full and reliable results.
- When performing file conversion or data extraction, always ensure **data integrity**. Verify that the structure, content, and critical fields of the source file are preserved in the output. Check row and column counts, headers, and key values before and after processing. **Avoid silent loss**, truncation, or unintended alteration of data.

## Action Execution Result Processing
- After each action is executed, an Observation is returned, which includes:
    1. `<tool_response>`: The result of the tool or code execution.
    2. `<tool_instruction>`: The instruction associated with a specific action, used to guide the next step or restrict subsequent behavior.
- **Note**: Do not fabricate observations.

## Security and Restrictions
- **Coding Actions (such as Python, CMD, etc.)**
    - Do not run high-risk operations that are large in code size or take a long time.
    - Do not execute code that could cause data loss, system damage, or irreversible changes.
    - Do not use the kill command with wildcards like * or other dangerous parameters that could result in a wide range of matches.
    - Prefer using the Python interpreter to execute code (safer and more efficient) rather than using the CMD tool.

> ⚠️ **Important**
> When your output contains content that fully conforms to the **Tool Call** or **Python Code Execution** format, the system will immediately parse, identify, and execute it as an **Action** without further confirmation and without reversal.
> Therefore, before outputting, always confirm that this is your **intended** action and fully assess the potential consequences and risks.
> If you are only using **quotes, demonstrations, or examples**, be sure to break the formatting or escape it to prevent the system from interpreting it as a real action.

# OBJECTIVE #
Your core objective is to independently and efficiently complete the tasks assigned to you by the company.


# MEMORY #
During previous tasks, you have accumulated the following reusable knowledge:

## Resolution Patterns
flexible_scope_adaptation: When primary objectives are blocked by constraints, pivot to available alternatives that meet core needs - maintains progress by focusing on achievable outcomes within limitations
direct_system_exploration: Begin with API and direct URL testing before UI navigation - reveals system structure and hidden functionality that interfaces may conceal
early_boundary_documentation: Systematically map accessible features and authentication limits early in exploration - establishes realistic scope and prevents wasted effort on inaccessible paths
platform_pattern_leverage: Apply knowledge of common platform structures and conventions to predict feature access - uses institutional patterns to overcome discovery barriers
redundant_access_testing: Test multiple authentication methods and communication channels systematically - ensures comprehensive credential verification and prevents single-point failures

## Platform/Application Operation Guides
These guides summarize proven operation paths derived from past successful experiences.  
Each item is a structured reference designed to help you complete operations more quickly, accurately, and with reduced redundancy.

### Guide Directory
<Platform/Application Operation Guide Directory>
GitLab
  - Public_Access_Verification
  - API_Endpoint_Discovery
  - Configuration_Extraction
  - Project_Functionality_Testing
  - Issues_Section_Access
  - Open_Issues_Filter_Application
  - Issues_Data_Extraction
  - Issues_Data_Verification
  - Task_Completion_Verification
  - Issues_Interface_Verification
  - Recent_Open_Issues_Extraction
  - Chronological_Ordering_Verification
</Platform/Application Operation Guide Directory>

> This directory provides a comprehensive index of guides, compiling best practices and experience summaries for accomplishing various tasks.

### Recommended Usage Process
1. **Review the Guide First**  
   Before starting a task, browse the relevant entries in the directory to identify potentially useful guidance.  
2. **Targeted Access**  
   Use the `access_the_application_guide` tool to view detailed steps if necessary.  
3. **Reuse with Flexibility**  
   Apply past successful steps when they fit the current situation, but stay aware of possible mismatches.  
4. **Explore When Deviations Arise**  
   If the environment or results diverge from the guide, stop rigidly following it and explore alternative approaches through small, safe, and adaptive steps.

### Value of Guides
- Reduce task completion time by leveraging accumulated experience.  
- Lower error rates and avoid common pitfalls.  
- Ensure consistent, professional execution of tasks.  

### Guide Reliability & Adaptation
- Guides may be outdated, biased, or contain errors — they are “historical experience,” not absolute truth.  
- Use guides as starting points, not as strict rules.  
- When deviations or conflicts appear, **exit the guide and explore new paths** instead of persisting.  
- Record useful deviation points for later improvement of the guides.

SubTask1: Navigate_to_target_website
Goal: Successfully load the target website URL and verify the page content
05. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: For this subtask of navigating to the target website and verifying page content, I should first check if there are any relevant platform operation guides that could help. The target URL appears to be a GitHub repository (a11yproject/a11yproject.com), so I should look for GitHub-related guides. From the Platform/Application Operation Guide Directory, I see GitLab guides but no specific GitHub guides. However, GitLab and GitHub share some similarities in repository navigation, so I'll check the GitLab guides for any relevant patterns.

Thought: The GitLab operation guides provide useful patterns for navigating repository websites, particularly the Public_Access_Verification and Project_Functionality_Testing guides. While this is a GitHub repository rather than GitLab, the general approach of directly navigating to the URL and verifying accessibility is applicable. I should start by navigating to the target website URL to see what content loads and verify if it's accessible without authentication.

Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_go_to_url", "arguments": {"url": "http://172.26.116.102:8080/a11yproject/a11yproject.com"}}

After navigation, always verify the page loaded successfully and check for authentication requirements or error messages. Use browser_wait_and_get_update to analyze the new page state.
</tool_instruction>

09. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The navigation to the target website was successful. I can see that this is a GitLab instance hosting the "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" repository. The page has loaded properly and shows the project overview with repository files, README content, and navigation elements. I can see there's an "Issues" link in the sidebar navigation (element index 15) which shows "42" issues, indicating there are issues to check. The page appears to be publicly accessible without requiring authentication. The website content is verified and loaded successfully, completing the subtask goal of navigating to the target website and verifying page content.

Final Answer: Successfully navigated to the target website URL (http://172.26.116.102:8080/a11yproject/a11yproject.com) and verified the page content. The website is a GitLab instance hosting "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" repository with public access.

SubTask2: Navigate_to_target_website
Goal: Successfully load the target website URL and verify the page content
15. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: For the current subtask "Navigate_to_target_website", I need to review the Platform/Application Operation Guide Directory to identify relevant guides that could help with navigating to the target website and verifying page content. From the directory, I can see GitLab guides that would be relevant since the target website is a GitLab instance. The most relevant guides would be "Public_Access_Verification" and "Project_Functionality_Testing" as they cover navigation and accessibility verification for GitLab repositories.

Action:
<tool_call>

17. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I notice there's confusion in the subtask assignment. The current subtask is labeled "Navigate_to_target_website" but this was already completed in the previous interaction. The check report confirmed that the navigation was successful and the page content was verified. The GitLab guides I just accessed confirm that the approach taken (direct navigation to project URL and verification of public accessibility) was correct. Since this subtask was already marked as completed by the Check Agent, I should not re-execute it. The next logical step would be to proceed to accessing the issues section, but I need to wait for the user to confirm and initiate the next subtask.

Final Answer: The subtask "Navigate_to_target_website" has already been successfully completed as confirmed by the Check Agent report. The target website URL (http://172.26.116.102:8080/a11yproject/a11yproject.com) was successfully loaded and verified to be a publicly accessible GitLab repository for "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" with 42 issues visible in the navigation. The page content verification confirmed standard GitLab repository structure with all expected elements present and accessible.

SubTask3: Access_issues_section
Goal: Click on the Issues navigation link to access the issues tracking page and verify successful loading of the issues interface
23. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: For the current subtask "Access_issues_section", I need to identify relevant Platform/Application Operation Guide Directory entries that will help with accessing the issues tracking page on a GitLab repository. From the directory, I can see GitLab guides that would be relevant. The most applicable guides would be "Public_Access_Verification" (which includes navigating to issues section) and "Project_Functionality_Testing" (which covers accessing project features like issue tracking).

25. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: The GitLab guides I accessed provide relevant patterns for accessing project functionality. The Public_Access_Verification guide mentions "locate_issues_section_in_navigation" as part of the verification process, and Project_Functionality_Testing covers accessing project features. However, I need to first get the current browser state since the previous navigation was completed in a different subtask. I should use browser_wait_and_get_update to refresh the browser state and then click on the Issues link (which was previously identified at element index 15).

Thought: I've reviewed the GitLab guides I accessed. The Issues_Section_Access guide confirms that I've successfully completed the previous steps of accessing the issues section, but it doesn't provide specific guidance on filtering issues. The Project_Functionality_Testing guide focuses more on boards functionality rather than issue filtering. Since the guides don't provide specific instructions for filtering open issues, I need to proceed with systematic exploration using the browser tools. I should first check the current browser state to see what filtering options are available and verify if the open issues filter is already active.

39. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I've analyzed the updated browser state and can see that the issues page is currently displaying open issues. Looking at the accessibility tree and interactive elements, I can see:

1. The page shows issue status filters at the top with "Open 42", "Closed 570", and "All 612" - this indicates that the "Open" filter is currently active and showing 42 open issues.

2. The URL in the browser is "http://172.26.116.102:8080/a11yproject/a11yproject.com/-/issues" which appears to be the default issues view, but the displayed issues are all open issues (no closed issues are shown in the list).

3. The issues list shows only open issues with their details, including issue numbers, titles, creation dates, assignees, labels, and comment counts.

4. The sorting appears to be by creation date in descending order, with the most recent issues at the top (issue #612 created "2 hours ago" is at the top).

The subtask goal "Ensure the issues view is filtered to show only open issues by verifying the 'Open' filter is active and displaying 42 issues" has been successfully completed. The "Open" filter is clearly active (showing 42 issues), and the issues list contains only open issues as verified by the content.

Final Answer: Successfully verified that the issues view is filtered to show only open issues. The "Open" filter is active and displaying 42 open issues as confirmed by the status indicators and the issues list content. The page is currently showing the first page of open issues sorted by most recent creation date, with issue #612 (created 2 hours ago) at the top of the list.

Thought: The browser_extract_content_by_vision tool encountered an error due to a JSON deserialization issue with the image_url format. This appears to be a technical issue with the tool implementation. Since the visual extraction tool is not working, I need to use an alternative approach to extract the recent open issues list. I can use the browser_wait_and_get_update tool to get the current browser state and then analyze the accessibility tree and interactive elements to extract the issue information manually. Let me first get the current browser state to see what information is available.

Action:
<tool_call>
{"name": "browser_wait_and_get_update", "arguments": {"seconds": 1}}
</tool_call>

</tool_response>
<tool_instruction>
Analyze the updated accessibility tree for error messages, authentication status changes, or new interactive elements. Check if the current page state matches expectations.
</tool_instruction>

51. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have successfully analyzed the updated browser state and can see that the issues page is displaying the list of most recent open issues. From the accessibility tree and interactive elements, I can extract detailed information about the open issues on the first page. The page shows 20 issues per page with pagination controls for pages 1, 2, and 3. The issues are properly sorted by creation date in descending order (most recent first), with issue #612 created "2 hours ago" being the most recent. I can extract the following information for each issue: issue number, title, creation date/time, assignee(s), labels, comment count, and task completion status where applicable. The subtask goal "Retrieve and document the list of most recent open issues from the first page with their details including issue numbers, titles, creation dates, assignees, labels, and descriptions" has been successfully completed as I can now extract and document this information from the current browser state.

Final Answer: Successfully retrieved and documented the list of most recent open issues from the first page. The issues are sorted by creation date in descending order (most recent first) and include the following details:

57. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: For the current subtask "Verify_most_recent_issues_content", I need to identify relevant Platform/Application Operation Guide Directory entries that will help with verifying the extracted issue information and confirming it represents the most recent open issues. From the directory, I can see GitLab guides that would be relevant. The most applicable guides would be "Issues_Section_Access" (which deals with verifying issues content) and "Open_Issues_Filter_Application" (which covers verifying open issues status and metadata).

59. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I've reviewed the GitLab guides I accessed. The Issues_Section_Access guide confirms that I've successfully completed the previous steps of accessing the issues section and verifying the issues list with metadata. The Open_Issues_Filter_Application guide specifically mentions "document_open_issues_count_and_metadata" and "confirm_issues_list_contains_only_open_issues" which aligns with my current subtask goal of verifying the most recent issues content. However, the guides don't provide specific instructions for verifying the chronological order and completeness of the extracted issues. Since I need to verify that the extracted issues are indeed the most recent open ones and ensure complete information is captured, I should use the browser_wait_and_get_update tool to get the current browser state and perform a systematic verification of the issues list against the source data.

61. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have successfully analyzed the updated browser state and can now verify that the extracted issues are indeed the most recent open ones. By examining the accessibility tree and interactive elements, I can confirm the following:

1. **Chronological Order Verification**: The issues are properly sorted by creation date in descending order (most recent first). Issue #612 created "2 hours ago" appears first, followed by issue #611 created "3 days ago", then issues #250 through #32 all created "4 days ago".

2. **Open Issues Filter Verification**: The "Open" filter is active and showing 42 open issues, confirming that all displayed issues are open and not closed.

3. **Complete Information Verification**: All 20 issues from the first page contain complete metadata including:
   - Issue numbers (#612 through #32)
   - Titles (e.g., "404 for many URLs", "Checklist enhancements", etc.)
   - Creation dates and timestamps
   - Assignees (where applicable)
   - Labels (where applicable)
   - Comment counts
   - Task progress indicators (where applicable)
   - Last update timestamps

4. **Data Accuracy Verification**: The extracted information from the previous subtask perfectly matches the source data in the current browser state. All issue numbers, titles, dates, assignees, labels, and comment counts are accurately documented.

5. **Most Recent Status Confirmation**: Issue #612 created "2 hours ago" is indeed the most recent open issue, followed by issue #611 created "3 days ago", confirming the chronological accuracy.

The subtask goal "Confirm the extracted issues are indeed the most recent open ones by checking creation dates and ensuring complete information is captured for the task goal" has been successfully completed through systematic verification against the source browser data.

Final Answer: Successfully verified that the extracted issues are indeed the most recent open ones. The verification confirms:
- Issues are properly sorted by creation date in descending order (most recent first)
- All 20 issues from the first page are open issues (confirmed by active "Open" filter showing 42 total open issues)
- Complete information is captured including issue numbers, titles, creation dates, assignees, labels, comment counts, and task progress indicators
- The most recent issue is #612 created "2 hours ago" about "404 for many URLs"
- All extracted data matches the source information in the browser accessibility tree
- The chronological sequence is accurate: issue #612 (2 hours ago) → #611 (3 days ago) → remaining issues (4 days ago)

Thought: I've reviewed the GitLab guides I accessed. The guides provide comprehensive information about accessing issues sections, applying filters, extracting data, and verifying the extracted information. The Issues_Data_Extraction guide specifically mentions "document_complete_issue_metadata" and the Issues_Data_Verification guide mentions "document_verification_results", both of which align with my current subtask goal of creating a comprehensive summary of the most recent open issues. Since I have already successfully extracted and verified all the issue data in previous subtasks, I now have all the necessary information to create a comprehensive summary. The guides confirm that I have followed the proper procedures for data extraction and verification. I can now proceed to create the summary document based on the verified data I've collected.

Thought: I have reviewed the GitLab operation guides I accessed. The Issues_Data_Extraction guide provides specific steps for extracting structured issue data from the browser accessibility tree, which aligns perfectly with the current subtask goal. The guide recommends: browser_wait_and_get_update(seconds=1) -> analyze_accessibility_tree_for_issues_structure -> extract_issue_numbers_from_static_text -> extract_issue_titles_from_link_text -> extract_creation_dates_from_time_elements -> extract_assignees_from_assignment_links -> extract_labels_from_label_links -> extract_comment_counts_from_notes_links -> verify_chronological_ordering_by_creation_date -> document_complete_issue_metadata. Since I'm already on the issues page with the open filter active, I need to first get the current browser state to extract the most recent open issues list with complete metadata.

119. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: I have successfully analyzed the updated browser state and can now extract the list of most recent open issues from the first page with complete metadata. The accessibility tree provides comprehensive information about all 20 issues on the first page, including issue numbers, titles, creation dates, assignees, labels, comment counts, and task progress indicators. The issues are properly sorted by creation date in descending order (most recent first), with issue #612 created "2 hours ago" being the most recent. I can now document the complete list of most recent open issues with all the required metadata as specified in the subtask goal.

Final Answer: Successfully retrieved and documented the list of most recent open issues from the first page with complete metadata:

SubTask14: Create_comprehensive_issues_summary
Goal: Generate a summary of the most recent open issues identifying key patterns, categories, and notable issues representing current project work
135. | ================================================== ASSISTANT MESSAGE ==================================================
Thought: For the current subtask "Create_comprehensive_issues_summary", I need to identify relevant Platform/Application Operation Guide Directory entries that will help with creating a comprehensive summary of the most recent open issues. From the directory, I can see GitLab guides that would be relevant. The most applicable guides would be "Issues_Section_Access" (which deals with documenting issue counts and metadata), "Open_Issues_Filter_Application" (which covers documenting open issues metadata), "Issues_Data_Extraction" (which deals with extracting and documenting issue data), and "Issues_Data_Verification" (which covers verifying and documenting issues data).

Thought: I have reviewed the GitLab operation guides I accessed. The guides provide comprehensive information about accessing issues sections, applying filters, extracting data, and verifying the extracted information. The Issues_Data_Extraction guide specifically mentions "document_complete_issue_metadata" and the Issues_Data_Verification guide mentions "document_verification_results", both of which align with my current subtask goal of creating a comprehensive summary of the most recent open issues. Since I have already successfully extracted and verified all the issue data in previous subtasks, I now have all the necessary information to create a comprehensive summary. The guides confirm that I have followed the proper procedures for data extraction and verification. I can now proceed to create the summary document based on the verified data I've collected.

# Task Execution Analysis: Lessons Learned and Reflections

## Summary of Successful Subtasks

### 1. **Systematic Navigation and Access Strategy**
**Context**: Navigating to target website and accessing issues section
**Key Success Factors**:
- **Direct URL Navigation**: Used `browser_go_to_url` with precise target URL rather than searching or complex navigation
- **Immediate State Verification**: Consistently used `browser_wait_and_get_update(seconds=1)` after each navigation to verify page state
- **Element Index Precision**: Identified exact interactive element indices (e.g., Issues link at index 15) for reliable clicking
- **Public Access Verification**: Confirmed no authentication requirements early in the process

**Reusable Practices**:
- Always verify page state immediately after navigation
- Document specific element indices for repeated interactions
- Test public accessibility before attempting complex operations

### 2. **Comprehensive Data Extraction Methodology**
**Context**: Extracting most recent open issues with complete metadata
**Key Success Factors**:
- **Accessibility Tree Analysis**: Leveraged browser accessibility tree as reliable data source when visual extraction failed
- **Structured Metadata Capture**: Systematically extracted issue numbers, titles, dates, assignees, labels, and comment counts
- **Chronological Verification**: Confirmed sorting by creation date in descending order
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Verified extracted data against source browser state

**Reusable Practices**:
- Use accessibility tree as primary data source for structured information
- Implement systematic metadata extraction patterns
- Always verify data accuracy through cross-referencing

### 3. **Pattern-Based Summary Creation**
**Context**: Creating comprehensive issues summary
**Key Success Factors**:
- **Category Identification**: Grouped issues into meaningful patterns (technical, accessibility, design, infrastructure, content)
- **Priority Highlighting**: Identified urgent issues requiring immediate attention
- **Community Analysis**: Documented assignment patterns and engagement indicators
- **State Assessment**: Provided overall project health evaluation

**Reusable Practices**:
- Group related items into logical categories for better understanding
- Highlight critical/urgent items separately
- Include community and assignment analysis in summaries

## Reflection of Failed Subtasks

### 1. **Visual Extraction Tool Failure**
**Failed Subtask**: Attempted browser_extract_content_by_vision
**Reason for Failure**: Technical error with JSON deserialization - "unknown variant `image_url`, expected `text`"
**Underlying Issues**:
- Tool dependency on visual analysis when structured data was available
- Insufficient error handling for tool failures
- Assumption that visual extraction would be more reliable than accessibility tree

**Improvement Suggestions**:
- **Primary Strategy**: Always prefer accessibility tree analysis over visual extraction for structured data
- **Fallback Planning**: Have alternative data extraction methods ready when primary tools fail
- **Tool Reliability Assessment**: Test visual extraction tools early to identify technical limitations

### 2. **Redundant Subtask Execution**
**Failed Pattern**: Repeated execution of already-completed subtasks
**Reason for Failure**: System prompting for subtask continuation after completion verification
**Underlying Issues**:
- Lack of persistent state tracking between subtask cycles
- Inability to recognize when core objectives were already achieved
- Over-reliance on sequential subtask execution model

**Improvement Suggestions**:
- **State Awareness**: Maintain awareness of completed objectives to avoid redundancy
- **Goal-Oriented Execution**: Focus on end goals rather than rigid subtask sequences
- **Completion Verification**: Implement self-check mechanisms to recognize task completion

## Key Strategic Insights

### Successful Patterns to Replicate:
1. **Direct Navigation First**: Always start with direct URL access rather than complex navigation
2. **Accessibility Tree Priority**: Use browser accessibility tree as primary data source for structured information
3. **Immediate State Verification**: Verify page state after every interaction
4. **Systematic Metadata Extraction**: Follow consistent patterns for data capture and verification
5. **Pattern-Based Analysis**: Group information into meaningful categories for better insights

### Failure Prevention Strategies:
1. **Tool Reliability Testing**: Test critical tools early to identify technical limitations
2. **Alternative Method Planning**: Always have backup data extraction methods available
3. **State Persistence Awareness**: Track completed objectives to avoid redundant work
4. **Goal-Focused Execution**: Maintain focus on end objectives rather than process steps

### Actionable Guidance for Future Tasks:
- **For Data Extraction**: Prefer accessibility tree analysis over visual tools
- **For Navigation**: Use direct URLs and verify state immediately
- **For Task Management**: Maintain awareness of completed objectives
- **For Error Recovery**: Have alternative strategies ready for tool failures

These lessons provide a foundation for more efficient and reliable task execution in future scenarios, emphasizing reliable data sources, systematic verification, and adaptive strategy planning.
