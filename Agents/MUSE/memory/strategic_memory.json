  "adaptive_criteria_management": "Flexibly adjust search criteria and scope based on system constraints and available alternatives - maintains progress by focusing on achievable outcomes while navigating platform-specific variations",
  "early_boundary_documentation": "Systematically map accessible features and authentication limits early in exploration - establishes realistic scope and prevents wasted effort on inaccessible paths",
  "platform_native_preference": "Prefer built-in platform mechanisms and leverage common design patterns - ensures reliability and consistency while reducing custom workaround complexity",
  "multi_indicator_verification": "Confirm success through multiple independent indicators (URL parameters, interface elements, data counts) - prevents single-source verification failures and provides comprehensive validation",
  "multi_method_redundancy": "Maintain multiple approaches for critical operations (extraction, navigation, authentication) - provides resilience when primary methods fail due to platform variations",
  "proactive_context_management": "Implement regular session resets and direct navigation during extended operations - prevents context accumulation and token limit issues for operational stability",
  "comprehensive_element_verification": "Verify interactive elements through multiple attributes (tag, href, text, functionality) before interaction - prevents misclicks and navigation errors in complex interfaces",
  "strategic_sampling_prioritization": "Focus on primary data sources and representative samples when exhaustive processing is impractical - balances completeness requirements with practical efficiency constraints",
  "technical_resilience_framework": "Test critical tools early and implement immediate fallback strategies - prevents single-point failures in technical operations through proactive validation",
  "incremental_validation_progression": "Validate each operation before proceeding to complex next steps - prevents error propagation and enables early issue detection in multi-step processes"
